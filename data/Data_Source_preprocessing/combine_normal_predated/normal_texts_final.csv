Right fuckin' here!,0
Aye.,0
Who wants some pretty Polly and a bit of the old in out? Meet me at the milk plus.,0
"Here's my son at age one, crashed out after a hard night of ""surprise visits"" for some trick-or-treatin'...    ",0
I just have to say that is the coolest freaking kids costume EVER. Although it looks like he had a bit too much milk plus.,0
i saw it when i was like 15. i think back and love the concept of the movie but i think i like it more now that im a LITTLE smarter,0
Great film.,0
One of the best films I ever viddied.,0
Great fucking movie!! One of the best ever.,0
great movie. Very unique!,0
"Friggin awesome flick. Loved The Shining too. And even though the story was kinda boring, Barry Lyndon was a gorgeous flick. First half of Full Metal Jacket was cool too.",0
"It's an incredible film. Stanley Kubrick is surely one of the greatest filmmakers of all-time. I would place him above Welles, Godard, Dreyer, Bergman, Fellini and Bunuel, and that's saying quite a bit.",0
"Stanley Kubrick, and seeing ""Clockwork Orange"" as a teenager were what made me start to study film as a potential art form, not just the Hollywood products shoved into release dates that I was used to up until that point (and that, more and more, movies tend towards now). It was just so unique and powerful, and in a way, through its own antisocial nature, it gave me the strength to get through those uncertain high school years, where I often felt caged up and institutionalized like Alex. A lot of people didn't understand it, wrote it off as too weird or disturbing (which it is, certainly was at the time, though times have changed), but then it's not meant to be a family film. I wrote like 2 papers on it in college.    Although I for one think filmmakers are far too casual with releasing Special Edition DVD versions of movies these days, there's one movie where it'd be really nice to see just that, so we might have something with promotional materials and essays and documentaries detailing its influence and transition to the screen, and with any luck, a commentary by Malcolm McDowell and Jan Harlan detailing their thoughts about it, and Kubrick himself (RIP, Stan).",0
Another fan here.    I even dressed like Alex last Saturday.        Indeed.,0
"Great film, book and soundtrack. One of Kubrick's best films, along with The Shining.",0
that a brillent movie  and the look of it  it just brillent movie,0
"kubrick is probably the most overated director in movie history , but even he couldnt screw up source material like clockwork orange",0
A Clockwork Orange is my second-favorite film.    ,0
"Excellent movie, excellent book. People think I can't like both, but they're two seperate things. And I Love both.",0
Love it!,0
"  I don't see what the problem is in liking both. Ah, I like them both, too.    ",0
"    A Clockwork Orange is one of the finest movies of all time, but i guess i still deserve to be shot.",0
    Anyone who would even consider comparing the two should be kicked in the yarbles...they are such different films.,0
who doesn'nt like a clockwork orange,0
"I was trying to figure out the title for a long time, and finally got a decent explaination. Apparently it's a close reference to the UK slang for a slot machine. They call em' fruit machines (I just heard it used the other day in an Arctic Monkey's song!) and the fact it has inner workings like a clock. Alex feels life is a gamble, etc etc.  Any other theories?",0
    from the author's own words. Even better! Thanks.,0
It has the best movie ending ever :),0
i watched it when i was maybe too young but i thought it was great!    though.. i wish i had watched it when it came out.. i am a bit desensitised    i think that the episode of the simpsons where bart dresses as alex is great too.. he looks really sweet! in a disturbing way?,0
fukn legendary movie,0
"read the book...it was awesome, , and the movie of course, kicked serious ass, , though i wish there were some more prison scenes like the book had.",0
"Oh ya, there's just something special about A Clockwork Orange, there's nothing else like it...not even close.  ",0
i just like that movie...,0
"I loved this movie, i have only seen it once but whoa. Great acting too :)",0
one of my favorites of all time and how about the music,0
"Alex: There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar trying to make up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening. The Korova milkbar sold milk-plus, milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom, which is what we were drinking. This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.    I wish we had a Korova Milkbar here ... with Pat Roach as a bouncer.    Alex: Excuse me, Mrs. Can you please help? There's been a terrible accident! My friend's in the middle of the road bleeding to death! Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?",0
"of course what a great movie cant believe it was banned for so long, i see worse on the news, a what an ending",0
(whispers: I prefer the book),0
"What part are you going for? Alex, I hope :)    It's really hard to find other books like ACwO... The kinds of things that come up as 'similar' to it are Catch-22, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, Slaughterhouse-5... You could do something from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but I really wouldn't know which part. Or something from The Wasp Factory?    There are some fair monologues in American Psycho, although I guess Bateman isn't close enough to an 'Alex' to convince your teachers you could play the part...      Bravo to your school though; edgy play to attempt!!",0
"Sorry, didn't notice: you're a girl! :P Doesn't mean you can't play Alex... he IS meant to be 15, so maybe 18 y/o boys will be too mature ;)    If you're not going for that part, may I ask what are you going for?",0
"You can absolutely be Alex as a girl...I dressed as him for halloween two years in a row...I had to improvise with the costume though...you'ld be amazed at how much attention a girl in a jock strap over white quilted long johns get...I was amazed however at how small the population of people that know this movie is. Everyone I know has seen it, but people would ask what are you, I'd tell them and get this blank stare...felt like beating the crap out of them with my walking stick!!!    Welly Welly.",0
      That rocks....did he pass out holding the cane like that ? wow he really go into the role!,0
"Last Halloween I dressed up as one of the students in Battle Royal... ah, nothing sexier than a school uniform covered in blood. Most people didnt get who I was meant to be, so I beat them with my plastic axe. Ah, happy days...",0
Gorgosity!!!,0
Brilliant Flick...,0
"""As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.""    I love this film fred",0
The book was better.,0
"I thought The Shining was a good movie, not the best but good. Scatman Crothers was the main reason why I've seen the movie.",0
I love The Shining....Jacks breakdown is so realistic.,0
i only watched like the last hour of it so i didnt get the whole story but it was ok,0
Diturbing but very good,0
i live in the same place as the hotel it was shot in... it was a good movie if i actually read the book i bet it would be better but i didn't so i like the movie ^^,0
The Shining is one of the few Stephen King movies I didnt think was cheesy. A great classic.,0
"the shining is class, did you notice that nicholsons wife in the film was a really bad actress, i think if they hadnt used such a strong actor as nicholson the film would have bombed.",0
I've never understood why he's so respected. all of his movies seem cheesy to me.,0
What makes the book so scary is Jack's slow descent into madness but a major flaw with the film is that Jack starts off as already crazy. When he smiles that famous grin with the crooked eye-brow we already know he's nuts. It takes the terror out of Jack's slow mental breakdown.,0
Jack Nichalson is an awsome actor.... he can act any part. and his movies are awsome,0
"It's a classic movie and the hotel it is based on (The Stanley Hotel) is really supposed to be haunted. My wife and I almost crashed off the road driving by it in the middle of a snow storm. At the time of the near accident, I was kidding around saying, ""I'm coming for you Danny boy!"" Ever since then I've been prohibited from doing impersonations while driving.",0
"the movie is a complete classic, visually stunning, the music is great, jack is great... but frankly the book scared me more (!)",0
"sorry , but i never rated the shining, i dont rate kubrick at all, my opinion.",0
"Fuckin' CLASSIC, despite what Stephen King says. Shelly Duvall is not a pretty woman but her performance exemplary. Nicholson was great, before this act of his became cliched (Batman, Witches of Eastwick).  What a creepy cast of ghouls! Philip Stone, Joe Turkel and those friggin' twins.  Oh, and let's not forget the old bag in the tub!",0
"Excellent film. Infact it was on t.v. last night and I watched it again, one of Kubrick's best films.",0
"    I prefer the movie to the book - animated bestial hedges are not scary, and Jack Nicholson's so good in the role. And that guy what plays the waiter-cum-Delbert O'Grady. The toilet scene is eerie in the book too, mind.",0
"Loved the book, not seen the film yet.    And those hedge animals were fucking creepy.",0
Be serious now! And that corny ending - KABOOM!,0
"I love this movie, but then again I love just about all of King's movie's",0
"I loved it, very scary, and Nicholson was brilliant in it.",0
"I love The Shining. Kubrick's vision is fantastic. A real atmospheric chiller, with a very chilling score too.",0
"I think that reading the book first spoils the movie, but the shining on its own is a brilliant movie, only Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson could do it ;)",0
"I love the Shining, although lets all be honest its getting kinda dated. The campy 70s interior of the Overlook is killing the wicked storyline. I think if you can overlook the camp factor the movie is a true classic. I'd love to see it redone, but cant think of anyone better than Jack...  We may be the last generation to truly love this movie in all its campy classic-ness...  How sad.",0
"I Live it everyday.Except my little friends Dr.Gonzo , not Tony....lol.",0
"first off. you cant compare books and movies. there two different mediums. of course the movie is going to leave stuff out. you really just cant comapare them.    two: the movie is technically based off the book, but lets be honest, half of the story was completely changed. its almost a whole other story.    i get so tired of all these elitest book worms thinking there art is so much better them film.",0
The shinning is a classic hands down! I wasn't really scared of the movies until I saw two scenes.    1. The hot naked chick turning into a old ugly woman.    2. A guy in the bear suite giving oral to some random dude.      The whole bear thing scared the shit out of me for a week!,0
"The Shining is good, but I got Dr Strangelove the other day and it's just brilliant in almost every way.",0
"Oh I forgot! ""RED RUM!!!!!""",0
"Well about two or three years ago, i had to write a review for this film and obviously had to analyze the film. I enjoyed it quite alot and have watched it again for pure entertainment. A good film overall.",0
        Never ceases to amaze me at the audacity of people to remake classics. For tv no less!! Id just love to be in a boardroom meeting when some dumbass comes up with an idea to redo a great film of the past.,0
"It's a classic, and also classic jack. BTW Shelly Duvall is not a horrible actress!  ""I'm not gonna hurt ya! I'm just gonna bash your fuckin brains in!""    CLASSIC    REDRUM REDRUM",0
It had luke skywalkers missing hand in it.,0
"3 kilos of coke, a pistol and The money from when the man and woman rob the diner. (depending on which events you think take place first).",0
"That baby from 2001. And Robert DeNiro's character from Brazil. And the lyrics to ""Louie, Louie."" And every character from every David Lynch film.    Mystery box.",0
A MacGuffin,0
Some light bulb that auto on when the briefcase is open.,0
"Its the same stuff in the case from ""Ronin."" Salery disputes made ""Ronin""'s crew to cut the stuffs appearance in that movie though.",0
"    I quite agree, this is the one explanation I heard and thought- that's it! That's what I think it is.    Backed up, of course, by the plaster, or, 'Band Aid' that's on the back of his neck, which legend says is where the Devil would pull the soul from...    Something like that anyways!",0
    Thats what Quentin Tarrantino said in an interview once.,0
"yeah, you need to watch 'kiss me deadly' and cross it with 'repo man'.",0
I heard a theory that its tinkerbell. Apparantly Disney and whichever studio did pulp fiction (cant remember right now) had a friendly understanding in which they would promote each others films in their own. Or something like that.    Cant remember where I read it or how valid it is but it would be cool if it was true!,0
    lol    I think Quentin enjoys the mystery of the situation,0
"If I had to guess, I'd say it was a suitcase full of laundered money, hence the ""my boss' dirty laundry."" But then again I take everything literally, so it's probably not it.",0
"It was Marcellus' soul which could be considered his ""dirty laundry"". Plus that is why they made sure you saw the bandaid on the back of his neck.",0
"Yes, thaaat's realistic. Two gangsters risk it all to return life essence to their boss?! Where do you people think it up.    Come on, if anything, we are led to assume that it's either cash [the dirty laundry line] or something else of high monetary value that would be worth it.  Don't try and interpret Pulp Fiction of all films as a fantasy/sci-fi movie.",0
"    Its Quentin Tarrantino for God's sake! Since when are his films the norm? Besides that was out of his mouth, not a guess on anyone's part.",0
It was Mr. Wallace's fairy god parents. Motherf*cking Cosmo and that B*tch Wanda!,0
"I can't beleive people are still talking about this.... well my theroies... Tarantino was once quizzed about the plaster/band-aid on the back of is neck, he responded by saying that Ving Rhames (Marselius Wallace) has a scar on the back of his neck, it was thought that this would be too distracting as he's a perfectionist and wanted the shot from the back of his head. Whoever made up the Devil-Removing-soul-from-back-of-next-(fact) is laughing his fucking ass of, because that has never been said in ANY documented writtings about Beelezebub (that i've found, feel free to correct me).  As for the contents of the case... Elvis's Gold Suit. Featured in Tarantino's True Romance (i know i know he only wrote it, don't feel free to correct me). Okay so i don't have much in the way of proof but this is Tarantino's quest he creates questions so people keep on talking about it for years to come. Like we're doing now.      Why is Reservoir Dogs called Reservoir Dogs?    I therefore rest my case m'lord.    Be Cool.",0
"I think it was Samuel Jackson's soul!! The ""Bad Mutha Fucka"" glow! Sho nuf!!",0
    Same here.,0
"    There isn't much debate over what events take place in what order. That's relatively easy to figure out in one viewing.    As for what is in the briefcase, I think people over think it. It doesn't really matter, it's sort of a fill in the blank for whatever is valuable to a gangster. Be that money, drugs, jewelry, or whatever. Just my opinion.",0
I've read that the Golden/Yellow glow from the briefcase represented the color of the Oscar statue as sort of an 'in' joke amoung Hollywood insiders because everyone in the film idustries dream is to win an Academy Award.,0
From what i know it's Marsellus Wallace's Soul.    That's why he has the bandaid on the back of his neck.  I've heard Tarantino say that.,0
"The theory I like is that it's the diamonds from Reservoir Dogs. The 'soul' theory is the most popular, I think.",0
"The truth is nothing is suppose to be in the breifcase. It's up to the viewer what is it in the case. Tarantino and Avary didn't know what to put in the case since they thought the diamonds from the heist in Reservoir Dogs wasn't original enough.    Also what religious text does it say the Devil takes the soul from the back of the neck? Rhames just had a scar on the back of his neck, and Tarantino being the perfectionist he is, didn't want the scar on screen. Hense the band-aid, and this is backed up by Tarantino himself.    The rest are just theories.",0
I figured it was gold. You know because of the Gold aura???? =),0
"For a long time I thought it was a gateway to hell, or something along those lines. But that was mostly due to the fact that the combination to the briefcase appeared to be ""666"" and when opened, it glowed orange/yellow/gold colors, resembling the colors of fire. That's wrong though I'm sure. I like the theory of Marcellus' soul",0
 Jimmy Hoffa... :),0
 LOL,0
"Haha, I thought it was Tarantino's script to Inglorious Bastards.",0
The reason why he did that was a trick on the audience. It's a way of pulling you in.  It's the same with Kill Bill when Beatrix's name is bleeped out.,0
the case had his keys in it  ,0
  and/or...  The Three Seashells mystery in Demolition Man... :),0
"  Pastors do the same thing in church. They'll be right in the middle of a statement and then say ""HELLO"", or something like it.  It's a way to keep us ADD people paying attention. lol",0
"  Not really the same...  The object with the Breifcase, Beatrix's name is bleeped out or The Three Seashells Mystery is to keep you thinking about the movie long after the movie is over. It plays in your head as you try to figure out the mystery or you come up with your own conclusions... :)",0
Everyone knows this was in the briefcase:  ,0
Everyone should know this was in the briefcase:  ,0
"ALL WRONG! HeHeHeHeHeHeHe!! It's Elvis' gold suit. Duh, even I knew that!",0

"Anyone can advise me some good recent horror movies, because everything I saw was bad and I always stick to the classics from 70s or 80s...",0
nothing is really a horror movie these days. how long has it been since you have seen a film that has seriously scared the crap out of you? although 'stay alive' i will admit is a little creepy..have you seen that?,0
"I'll check Stay Alive then... I heard it was not too bad. Last movie that scared me? I would say Dark Water (original japanese)... not since. Last one I saw was the remake of The Hills Have Eyes, it sucks.",0
"Have you seen A Tale of Two Sisters? Scary, and makes you think.",0
is it the one with two twin sisters? from Korea or Thailand?,0
"    For A Tale of Two Sisters ... yes, it's Korean.",0
uzumaki  its a sweet movie,0
"    Yeah I saw it, it is indeed a great movie. Korean's best one remains Old Boy although!!",0
"yes  oldboy  owns everything  not really horror, but an excellent film nonetheless",0
"Slither and Feast. Fun, campy horror movies, underrated or unseen but worth the time and effort in acquiring. Forget all these pseudo horror movies coming out recently.    And if you like Zombie movies. George Romero is the go to guy. All his movies are social commentaries as well as zombie eating good times.",0
SILENT HILL,0

"Anyone seen""Finding Nemo""? Talking animals, thats scary!! best recent-ish horror has to be 28 days later, its scary cos it's true!!",0
"    Im Sorry The Hill have eyes Scared the Freaking shit out of me! i wont watch it again! lol.    i watched 60 most scary movies on bravo and they said Hostel was number 1! I get scared too easily, So me tell u a scary movie u probly wouldnt even flintch.    But I do Have to agree with u, The scariest movies are the ones from back in the Day, It, Shinning.. Shit like that i definetly can not watch.. Saw 1 and 2 I thought was made really good. I havent seen 3 yet.. What scare me most about those movies are those are actually real devices that were used to kill people..(spanish tortuing devices) .. Scary!!!!!",0
"The Descent is scary.    I never saw the Japanese version of The Grudge, but the American version just seemed to be a boo movie. I wondered if the Japanese movie had a stronger story thread.    Creepy kids and herky-jerky dead people used to get me going, but the herky-jerky stuff has become a cottage industry. People who use it now should pay a royalty.",0

Have you seen the movie May? Wasnt really scary but it was pretty disturbing..

The Audition is pretty creepy the other asian movies that I've seen that creep me out are:  Ju-On  Suicide Circle  Tell Me Something  Three,0

"im gonna put my vote for bale as batman, however I did prefer tim burtons direction. wish he would do another one.    I have to say i was terribly disappointed with maguire as spiderman. in my mind, from reading the comics and watching the cartoons as i grew up Peter Parker was not a whining lil dork but a confident witty and highly intelligent kid, trying to make his way day to day and putting up with hassels of his home life.    i just found it sad that intelligence was veiwed as ""geekiness""",0
"    Go back and look at 1960's Spider-Man comics. That's what they're going for in the movies. And he was a geek. A skinny, brainy geek that suddenly got powers. I think Tobey nailed that.",0

   Jack Nicholson - The Joker,0
yep,0
   david hasselhoff...NICK FURY!!!,0
yup,0
      Nope :) If they're going to have a black james bond they need to make sure it's the dude that played opposite the other dude in Equilibrium . . man I can't remember anybody's name right now.,0
Taye Diggs,0
And I've never liked them chaning up characters from history like they did with the Green Lantern. They don't need to make a black James Bond. They just need to come out with a completely fresh and new Spy series with a new black character. Starting with Taye Diggs :),0
"I'll watch anything with Denzel, he's a great actor",0
"Denzel is definetely awesome, but do y'all not think he'd bee a bit too old for James Bond?",0
"Eh, he doesnt look to old, i wouldnt mind seeing him try",0
"WHY THE HELL would they have a black 007!?????    Are you forgetting that James Bond is a character from Ian Fleming's famous series of spy novels!? James Bond is famously a WHITE guy! It's rediculous to change the colour of his skin. Its nothing racial, simply respectful to Fleming's character!",0
"so your saying make James Bond an ever angry black man?    Sorry,  Denzel is not that good of an actor. He has about the same range as Bruce Willis. Bond is not an American character so the actor should not be American.    You want a good angry black man movie, have these well known people in it:  Denzel Washington  Samuel Jackson  Laurence Fishburn  Jada Pinkett Smith (as a side kick so she is extra angry)  and you will have a sure fire hit on the strength.",0
"    Plus the actor playing Bond is usually British. So Denzel fails anyway, even if they were to have a black bond it would be a British black actor.",0
"    I say no to the black actor idea also. Not for any reasons people knee jerk about, but because we have a history with James Bond. Don't go messin that up. As the other person said already, create a whole new character and series. Sort of like they did with XxX.",0
"God help us if they do introduce a black 007....    But IF they must, then I vote for Michael Richards to play the villain!!!!!!! :)",0
James Bond has always been white. Not to sound racial but it should stay that way or it'd change everything that is James Bond. Can you imagine someone like Jet Li being James Bond? It just would be James Bond anymore.,0
"I think i'll stick with Craig, Daniel Craig.",0
"    Yeah it would be Enter The Dragon or something. Keep historical figures the way they have always been, and make up new characters.    People got mad when they changed Cat Woman. But there was a black cat woman in the 60s, I forgot her name.    I got upset when they changed The Green Lanern to a black guy. I figured they caved under political correctness. But somebody told me that there are 100s of Green Lanterns from another planet.    But when there is a historical track record of a character, keep him the way he has always been (or her).",0
But for the oringinal ? no i don't think he should i think he would be great in it but james bond anit even american.However if he can get the british accent down i don't see why not because there are black people that live in europe so i wouldn't have a problem with it.,0
i think emmanuel lewis should be the next bond,0
    Id love to see this they could get someone like wee man or maybe the guy who played mini me!,0
"lol,  lakeland,  dude,  get a clue.",0
        Get a clue about what?Your denzel sucks opinion is based on nothing why does he suck in your opinon?Name one movie he has gave a bad performence in?,0
"no problem, I'll give you two Carbon Copy and Virtuosity.    I am not even going to get into his newer stuff because he is just an angry black man. Like I said, as much range as Bruce Willis, no matter what he does, its Bruce Willis. No matter what Denzel does, its just Denzel. Not hating on the guy, just call it as I see it.    As a person, he is a good fella. A buddy of mine has worked with him a few times, most recently on Deja Vu. Denzel can play a practical joke and take one as well. Not easily said for the likes of Tom Cruise.",0
    Okay Carbon copy was his first movie alot of great actor's dont give good performance's in thier first movie and Virtuosity was a bad movie all together so your is still invalid.So are you saying the guy has no talent or you just you don't like his style?,0
"It takes talent to remember lines but for acting gigs Denzel desperatly needs to expand his horizons away from the angry black man with a smirk. A great actor can bring a character to life where nobody else could. In other words, you can not imagine anyone else in the role such as Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.      as far as my two picks of bad films being invalid, nope, you asked for one I gave you two, lol.",0
What about a white Shaft (that sounds dirty)  white Blade  white Foxy Brown  white Fat Albert  on and on and on....    Oh and what Hally Berry played wasn't Cat Woman. The just stole the name for marketing purposes.,0
"ooohh,  your onto something there!  How about a Puerto Rican James Bond and the Bond girl is his sister that all the villains are trying to sleep with hence forth the plot.",0
"    That's what I was thinking. That doesn't make any damn sense. Plus Bond fans would be pissed. Hell, I'm not even a Bond fan and I'd still be pissed.",0
"    How about that James Bond is white?    A black James Bond wouldn't work. A spy film with a black guy in it would, but James Bond is white. You might as well make James Bond a transexual with one leg as well. And set it in 13th Century Wales. It's the same as all those idiots wanting a woman to play Doctor Who-it would feel 'wrong'.",0
        Harrison Ford?Hahaha.Idiana jones had no good acting he ran and jumped and look for shit.I mean you speak about great character's.Have you seen training day i think he gave some life to that movie he made ethan hawke who is a great actor look like It was his first movie.Not to mention malcolm X how can you see that movie and not say denzel is one of the best?,0
"Obviously you didnt read what I wrote, it was an example.  Can you imagine Indiana Jones played by anyone other than Harrison Ford. Can you imagine Indy played by Tom Sellick because thats who the part was written as and for, Magnum PI. Harrison Ford is the last great classic action star no doubt about it.    As far as Training Day, anyone pretty much could step right into that role. Yes I have seen it and still to this day wonder why anyone can see it as a great film. Ethan Hawk is a great actor? When did this happen? Not sure we watched the same film or is it the age gap?    Malcolm X,  You first need to realise and understand, was a real person. All you need to do with when portraying a real person is impersonate them. There is plenty of footage of the real person to study from. He did not create a character, he impersonated a person. Maybe its just me but there is enough drama in real life to sit down and watch someone else's drama on film. I tried watching Malcolm X and just couldnt do it, boring and just uninteresting to me personaly but o each their own.    Pretty much any actor will tell you, drama is easy, comedy is hard.",0
"    if they have a black bond, nobody would be cooler than don cheadle.",0
mos def.,0
"your all missing the main point here , , BOND IS""NT BLACK , his parents were scottish and swiss , , and no matter how mant political correct kudos it gets you, bond is a white western european , so deal with it.",0
    Denzel is great!! I don't think he'd be too old. He looks a lot younger than Daniel Craig (who happens to be 38 but looks almost 60).,0
"all of the previous Bonds had an older look and thats how it should be, life experianced with nothing to lose.",0
"Well I guess it WOULD be better to cast someone young who looks Old as hell! They should've kept Pierce in that case, he could've still been Bond. If I was a Bond girl, I'd go with Pierce over Daniel Craig any day.",0
I take it you dont know much about the industry ken?,0
i heard puff daddy wanted the role.    you know whats really cool about p diddy?      nothing.,0
"yeah Ken,  I know NOTHING about being on the ""Creative"" end, lol.",0
"The chances of a black actor getting to portray James Bond is about the chance that a white actor can portray Malcolm X, MLK, or anyone else for that matter.",0
has anybody seen it?    the box office take says yes    and the reviews are mostly good,0
I LOVED IT.......sooo good....and people need to lay off on the guy......must see.....it was 2 1/2 hrs long but it didn't seem like it,0
"I just hope it's sufficiently better than Passion of the Christ. Anyway, people do need to lay off Gibson. He was drunk, and he apologized.",0
"I can see him being drunk when he made The Passion of the Christ, but I didn't know he apologized for it.",0
it was good. Violent as hell. Mel has some serious blood lust issues.,0
"""Mel has some serious blood lust issues.""    i suspect that it's an accurate portrayal    of the bloodlust that existed in the real    lives of those ancient people",0
"i suspect that it's an accurate portrayal    of the bloodlust that existed in the real    lives of those ancient people >>>    The Aztecs were few in number compared to neighboring tribes, so war games that ended in human sacrifice meant fewer enemies. And fear is also a great weapon to keep a population under control.    I think it was more political than bloodlust.

    What Christian doesn't? Let's give the guy a break. He was Mad Max.,0
"    hey Im not complaining. I like watching a good spear thru the head as much as the next guy. Mel's blood lust is my viewing pleasure. And as much as professor Claven's yapping about historical accuracy is true, I think its pretty damn obvious looking at his films the man likes displaying his ultraviolence. There is complete justification for the horrific realism in Passion of the Christ too. It definitley worked for the effect he was going for. But he was having way too much fun with beating down ol' JC.",0
"    Call me crazy, but isn't this movie about the Mayans? I haven't seen it yet, but if the movie is ultraviolent, then it's historically accurate. The mayans were a blood thristy violent race of people. I've visited mayan ruins and learned about the history behind them. They were savages, pure and simple, and if the film wasn't ultraviolent it would be doing a disservice to the reality behind their culture.",0
i thought the ending was weak....it left it too open for interpretation as to....were the xtian spanish there as savior types? or were they put in at the end to give the movie a what comes around goes around moral? it seemed like they ran out of money or time and left it hanging at the end.,0
dude this movie was awsome i thought. the only thing was i have no idea what the beheadings were all about. can anyone tell me? i didnt know that was going on. also was the virus and disease going around from when the europeans came to town? that wasnt columbus at the end was it? the lady havin the baby in the water was a little extreme but man it was an awsome movie,0
Isn't that whole movie in a different language?,0
Yes.,0
      BUT HE MAD JEW HATING,0
"    Yes, I've seen it. I have a short review on my page (don't know if this is permitted to say, so delete /ignore/whatever! if so)    I highly recommend reading something about the movie before seeing it, if you plan to. Otherwise, most people will be befuddled, as the apparent plot isn't extremely clear - and lost in translation a bit too! I'm fascinated with the Inca, Aztec and Mayan cultures so was looking forward to seeing this. Don't know that this is a spectacular movie, but I think the depiction of the culture is pretty accurate.

"my best friend goes to UT austin. i visit her a lot up there. she has some likes and dislikes about it. however, it all depends on what u want to study. some schools have better programs in different things than other schools...like u of houston (go coogs!) we have a really good psychology program and music program...and business...texas southern (right across from us) has a really good pharmacy program.",0
"UT is an awesome school. I miss the long walks to class & the bus rides. (I really do! haha) I had a great time while I was in Austin... coffee shops, live shows, football, & Leslie! I didn't enjoy it as much as I would've liked towards the end (b/c of work/studying), but I would definitely recommend it. I hope to move back to Austin in a couple years. Can't wait!",0

The beach is sweet school to go to!,0
i m going to CSULB next year....lolz...,0
Third year and still lovin it!!!!!,0
I think it's by far one of the best schools in the country. The only problem is you have to get yourself involved before it gets good. Have never had a problem making a friend here either.,0
"Do you guys really not like it there? CSULB is one of my top schools that I'm applying to. My majors fit there, and the location is perfect for me. But is it really not all it's cracked up to be?",0
"I've found that the people who complain about it being like high school are the same people that went to high school within 25-30 miles of it. That's the problem with a lot of commuter schools, (I grew up near Sacramento State).    I've also found that the people who love it tend to be the one's who get themselves involved. I moved onto campus at CSULB 2 1/2 years ago not knowing a single person -- and now I know plenty of people. I have more friends now than I did in high school and a more active social life for sure. And I was damn busy with my life in high school!        College is what you make it.      Although I will say that the lack of football or other tailgating sport may contribute to the lack of school spirit. But, really, often when I'm out and about wearing CSULB stuff (either in northern or southern california) people will come up and start talking to me about our sports anyway... I just smile and tell them that the sociology and human development are good.",0
csulb is/was thee best!,0
"I know a couple people that go there and they say its easy as shit, but its really hard to get out of there in 4 years because of how hard it is to get the classes you need for your major.",0
"For those who complain about not being able to meet people or it's like high school, then they should really put themselves out there to meet new people. I've been at Long Beach State for 4 years now and I have tons of school spirit, more friends than I could count, met hundreds of hot girls, partied like there was no tomorrow, and taken some of the most thought provoking classes that makes you really think about life.  College is about being on your own and having freedom, it's not about sticking to your old high school buddies because it's comfortable or cuz you're too much of a pussy to get out there and make something happen for yourself. Like the saying goes, ""GO BEACH OR GO HOME!!!""",0
"Damn little freshman. The Beach is where it's at. You're probably not having a good time and think it's too much like high school cuz you're only stickin too your little high school friends. You're in college now, get out there and meet people! In other words...grow up!",0

Having cocktails at the nugget & the dorms are pretty fun. well they are until the boys roll up with you with their christmas lights and handcuff you for enjoying a forsty cold beverage outside the dorms. weenies. i don't believe i'm much of a fan of the campus police dept.,0
"In the year that I was allowed to go there, I partied more then I did in High school. Kinda hard to do, but somehow it was achieved. School wan't too bad either.",0
"I just transferred here from OCC in Fall 2004. I think the people and the professors are really great. But what do you guys mean by ""put yourself out there""? I'm a commuter and I work so I find it hard to meet ppl. (I just go to class then leave cause I have to get to work). I just bought a condo so I can't exactly move to LB. Also, I find it really hard to meet ppl my age: everyone's either young or old. I want to make some friends so HELP! Send me a message if you can/want.    Thanks guys",0
A friend of mine goes there and he really likes it. He was a screw up in High School and he went to com. college for a couple of years and now he is really achieving serious potential. I think that it might be good for some people and not for others...    raissa,0
i just moved here to long beach from the second largest campus in the country (the ohio state university) granted csulb is no big ten school it's easy as fuck to make friends here... any school you go to you will have people complaining that its like high school if you know tons of people that go to high school there.... 30% of my high school in ohio went to ohio state many of whom were my friends.... but when i left all my everyday friends were people i met in bars and at parties or on campus in classes or study groups... stop bitching about it being like high school.... maybe next time you walk to class instead of talking on your cell phone to your loser high school friends you should be signing up for organizations and social clubs... theyre there for a reason,0

"ive not heard that boris will scrap free transport,   is that free transport for who? old people, i dont think he would be allowed to do that, people would screw",0
"infact who apart from old and disabledÂ people get free transport?  i never had free transport ever,   infact this last week has cost me about 140 quid because of a broken oyster machine and its knock on effects  theres me sluggin my guts out and ppl get free transport?   im gettin sick ofÂ TFL, they treat you like cattle and mug youÂ off when something goes wrong and it neverÂ endsÂ    infact that settles it, im not voting for ken purely because of TFL, they disgust me as a company, and the worst thing is I am dependant on them....Â I give them money everyday",0
"    lol  the first point is quite an outlandish claim to make, boris has only mentioned london in the house of commons once, are you sure?????   i agree the fact he is from london and always lived hereÂ is a good point, but it doesnt mean he hasnt been filling his boots at our expense in the meantime like the rest of them, ken brought in bob from new york to sort out the tube, the guy was a raging alcoholic who had a breakdown, did an interview in the standard saying he hasnt done anything and is still gettin paid   ",0

"     you cant credit ken for the london olympics, east london is as prime a location for an olympics, all that waste land in east london needed something doing with it, ken was in the right place at the right time and jumped on the bandwagon,  seb coe ran the bid to the olympic commitee, big business sponsored it, david beckham swung the vote  ANY mayor would have said yes to the olympics considering the prestige atatched to it,   personally i think the olympics will be a big waste of money that wont actually help the people who live in east london much, just price them out of their own areas  i also disagree with you on the transport for london, yes the tories ballsed up on things a while ago, but a lot of time has passed since then, a lot of money has been spent on the underground since ken got in power and the only difference in service has been the price of ticket as far as i can see and i use it every day,  there was the fiasco of bob kielly or whatever he's called, the dude who ran new yorks subway, he did an interview with the evening standard where he confessed he was an alcoholic and a waste of our money, but ken stuck with him, that guy is on a whopping big contract, between 1-400k a year, i dont remember exactly, google it, but he got paid like a prince to get fucking pissed everyday    what kids get free transport? i never had free transport EVER when i was growing up, screw these free transport kids, they need to learn the value of money at some point otherwise your just breeding the next welfare generation",0

"maybe true,   but if you had to payÂ 30 quidÂ a week out of your own wages to get transport that was usually either late, overcrowded, disrupted or dangerous, you would be a lot more concerned with who runs it and how much they charge  if i got something for free, i would be satisfied with any standard of service as it hasnt cost me anything  by giving youÂ free transport ken is effectively trying to buy off the next generation of voters who are more likely to vote than someone with a fulltime job and family and commitments, and giving the bill to the rest of us,  for every free student transport pass, that is 1500 quid a year roughly he is adding onto the rest of londons travel costs  you will spend more of your life paying full price than on childrens free pass, will u still be as grateful when your 30yrs oldÂ and having to pay up to 40 or 50 a week on travel costs because more and more potential voters get free travel passes and you have to pay the bill?   there is no real need for teenagers to have free transport, non   old people, disabled people yes   young people no,  i agree with discounted travel for the young, but free..... thats taking the piss and shameless aimed at getting new voters    ",0

"HOPKINSVILLE, Ky. - A class of third-grade students got a lesson in civil liberties when an envelope containing $5 disappeared from their teacher's desk.  The students at Martin Luther King Elementary in Hopkinsville were asked to remove their shoes and socks during a search. Some were patted down and had their pockets checked. Some parents were angered by the Feb. 15 searches, which did not turn up the missing money at the western Kentucky school. ""The way they treat our students is ridiculous,"" said Zlatko Skuljan, the father of a 9-year-old girl in the class. The school's principal gave written reprimands to four instructors who had physical contact with the students. The principal, Sarah Newman, declined to comment and phone numbers for the four teachers could not be located Wednesday. Christian County Schools spokeswoman Regan Huneycutt said the search violated the school district's policy. School employees can touch students only when the student poses a threat to another student or to themselves. School officials said the search was prompted by the disappearance of an envelope containing $5 for a school function that was on the teacher's desk. The students' regular teacher was absent that day.  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080227/ap_on_fe_st/odd_students_sea rched;_ylt=ApBpqqqYP5pGKaE8WfSqKPztiBIF",0

It could have been another teacher, a janitor or any other adult to take the money -- it could have even been mistakenly mixed up with other papers or thrown out (have you ever seen a teacher's desk in the middle of the day?)

"  There are exceptions to the 4th Amendment in relation to public schools. Read this:  Public Schools .--In New Jersey v. T.L.O.,  108 the Court set forth the principles governing searches by public school authorities. The Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by public school officials because ''school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents.''  109 However, ''the school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject.''  110 Neither the warrant requirement nor the probable cause standard is appropriate, the Court ruled. Instead, a simple reasonableness standard governs all searches of students' persons and effects by school authorities.  111 A search must be reasonable at its inception, i.e., there must be ''reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.''  112 School searches must also be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances justifying the interference, and ''not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.''  113 In applying these rules, the Court upheld as reasonable the search of a student's purse to determine whether the student, accused of violating a school rule by smoking in the lavatory, possessed cigarettes. The search for cigarettes uncovered evidence of drug activity held admissible in a prosecution under the juvenile laws.     Click here for source",0

"Fallon 'may lose job over Iran war'  Adm.William Fallon, the head of the US Central Command, may lose his jobfor opposing President Bush's plans to wage war against Iran. According to a new Esquirearticle by Thomas Barnett; Admiral Fallon may be prematurely 'relievedof his command' as soon as this summer to be replaced with a more'pliable' commander.  ""If that were to happen, it maywell mean that the president and vice-president intend to take militaryaction against Iran before the end of this year and don't want acommander standing in their way,"" says the article which will bepublished on March 12.  Admiral Fallon, who has beennamed as 'one of the best strategic thinkers in uniform today' byDefense Secretary Robert Gates, opposed the troops surge in Iraq andhas consistently battled with President George W. Bush to avertconfrontation with Iran.  The Navy admiral has vowed thatan attack on Iran would 'not happen on his watch', calling the WhiteHouse warmongering echelons 'not helpful'.  Washington and its allies are at loggerheads with the Islamic Republic over the country's nuclear standoff with the West.  TheBush administration accuses Iran of pursuing nuclear weaponry, whileTehran maintains its uranium enrichment will only provide fuel for thecountry's under-construction nuclear power plants.  PresidentBush insists the military option against Iran remains on the table,while his top military experts, including Admiral Fallon, urge theWhite House to choose a diplomatic approach towards Tehran.  In a Thursday White House press briefing, spokeswoman Dana Perino was asked about the Esquire piece and refused to confirm whether Fallon's position is secure until the end of his tenure.",0
"I guess he's too liberal for them, like Peter Pace, whose term - one of the shortest in history - as chairman of the joint chiefs, ended soon after he argued that evidence of Iranian military hardware in Iraq is not evidence of their state sanction, at least not at the highest levels. that apparently, didn't go over well at the neocon nerve center (pentagon).",0

" An Admiral Takes on the White House By Gareth Porter Go to Original Washington - A new article on CENTCOM commander Adm. William Fallonconfirms that his public statements last fall ruling out war againstIran last fall were not coordinated with the White House and landed himin trouble more than once with President George W. Bush and VicePresident Dick Cheney. In anadmiring article on Fallon in Esquire, former Pentagon official ThomasP.M. Barnett writes that Fallon angered the White House by ""brazenlychallenging"" Bush on his aggressive threat of war against Tehran.Barnett also cites ""well-placed observers"" as saying Bush may soonreplace Fallon with a ""more pliable"" commander. Barnett's account, which quotes conversations with Fallon during theCENTCOM commander's trips to the Middle East, shows that Fallonprivately justified his statements contradicting the Bush policy ofkeeping the ""option"" of an unprovoked attack on Iran ""on the table"" asnecessary to calm the fears of Egypt and other friendly Arab regimes ofa US-Iran war. Barnett recalls thatwhen Fallon was in Cairo in November, the lead story in that day'sedition of the English-language daily Egyptian Gazette carried theheadline ""US Rules Out Strike against Iran"" over a picture of Fallonmeeting with President Hosni Mubarak. That story, published Nov. 19 and not picked up by any US news media,reported that Fallon had ""ruled out a possible strike against Iran andsaid Washington was mulling nonmilitary options instead."" Later that day, according to Barnett, Fallon told him during a coffeebreak in a military meeting, ""I'm in hot water again,"" and thenconfirmed that his problems were directly with the White House. That was the second time in less than a week and the third time inseven weeks that Fallon had publicly declared that there would be nowar against Iran. In an interview with Al-Jazeera television inSeptember, which Fallon himself had requested, according to a source atAl-Jazeera, he had said, ""This constant drum beat of conflict is whatstrikes me which is not helpful and not useful."" And only a week before the trip to Egypt, in an interview withFinancial Times, Fallon had said, a military strike was not ""in theoffing,"" adding, ""Another war is just not where we want to go."" These statements represented an extraordinary exercise of power by acombat commander, because it contradicted a central feature of theBush-Cheney strategy on Iran. High-ranking Bush administrationofficials had been routinely repeating the administration's line thatno option had been taken ""off the table"" since early 2005. At an Oct. 17 news conference, Bush said he had ""told people that ifyou're interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought tobe interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary tomake a nuclear weapon."" Fallon'spublic statements explicitly ruling out an attack on Iran thusundermined the Bush administration's threat against Iran. The willingness of the top commander in the Middle East to take themilitary option ""off the table"" was in part a reflection of thedetermination of uniformed military leaders to prevent what theyregarded as a disastrous course. Thenew chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, whoreplaced Gen. Peter Pace in June, was even more candid about hisopposition to the use of force against Iran than Pace had been,according to a Congressional staffer who had participated in privatemeetings with both. Pace declared publicly in late October, ""We have tobe mindful of the risks that would [be spawned] by engaging in a thirdconflict"" in the region. Mullen added, however, that military options ""cannot be taken off the table."" But Fallon, as the commander responsible for the entire Middle East,was concerned about more than the consequences of actually exercisingthe military option. He was prompted to enunciate a ""no-war"" line onIran by the panicky reactions of Arab states to what they thought wereindications of the warlike intentions of Bush administration. In the latter half of 2007 friendly Arab regimes were upset by thepossibility of a US-Iran war, which they feared would destabilize theentire region. Fallon is quoted as telling Barnett, ""[I]t's all anyonewants to talk about right now. People here hear what I'm saying andunderstand. I don't want to get them too spun up."" Fallon told Barnett that his ruling out of military action against Iranwas necessary to calm the very regimes the Bush administration washoping to enlist to support its anti-Iran line. ""Washington interpretsthis as all aimed at them,"" Fallon said in Cairo, according to Barnett.""Instead, it's aimed at governments and media in this region. I'm nottalking about the White House."" Fallon was arguing, in effect, that it makes no sense to make thepossibility of an unprovoked attack part of your declaratory policy ifmerely induces confusion and panic among friendly governments withoutinfluencing the target of the threat. Barnett quotes Fallon as complaining that ""they"" - meaning White Houseofficials - were asking him, ""Why are you even meeting with Mubarak?""But Fallon strongly defended the diplomatic role he was playing inrelations with Mubarak and other Middle Eastern leaders. ""This is mycenter of gravity,"" Fallon told him. ""This is my job."" Fallon's sensitivity to the political-diplomatic consequences of adeclaratory policy that explicitly keeps open the threat of anaggressive war as a potential option set him apart not only from theWhite House but from the consensus among national security specialistsin both parties. In early 2007, all three of the top three Democraticcontenders for the presidential nomination publicly declared theirsupport for keeping ""all options on the table."" Fallon is not the first CENTCOM commander to rein in aggressive WhiteHouse policy toward the Middle East. In late 1997, according to DanaPriest's book, The Mission, the Bill Clinton White House wanted CENTCOMcommander Gen. Anthony Zinni to order his pilots to provoke a militaryconfrontation with Iraq in the no-fly zone by deliberately drawing firefrom Iraqi planes. The request forsuch a provocation was conveyed to Zinni by the vice chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Ralston. But Zinni, who believed thatit could lead to an unwanted war with Iraq, insisted that a formalrequest from the White House would have to be sent, and the plan wasdropped. The unhappiness of the Bushadministration with Fallon's role as well as the unflattering pictureof administration policy revealed by the article was evident Thursdayfrom the failure of either the White House or the Pentagon to issue theusual reassuring statements in response to the article. The White House declined to comment, although, according to theWashington Post's Thomas Ricks, the article ""was being discussedthere."" The Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said Secretary ofDefense Robert M. Gates ""has read the profile on Admiral Fallon butchooses not to comment on it or other press accounts.""",0
"It's the ""Oh Shit!"" Moment on Iran  by  Dave Lindorff | March 12, 2008 - 8:18am  Everyhorrormovie has that ""Oh Shit!"" moment, when the hero or heroes arehuddled insome creepy hideout, and suddenly something happens thattells you thatthe monster is just around the corner, or just about toattack. In""Jurassic Park"" it was the pulsing ripples in a cup ofwater, heraldingthe arrival of a T-Rex. In ""Jaws"" it was the deep bassmusic, lettingyou know that a monstrous shark was about to attack. Well,we justgot our ""Oh Shit!"" moment with the just-announced resignationof AdmiralWilliam J. Fallon, the military commander of US Middle Eastoperations. Adm.Fallon, 63, famously said that an attack onIran would not happen ""on mywatch,"" and is widely believed to havealready threatened, along with anumber of other top generals andadmirals, to quit the service if theBush administration were to launchan air attack on Iran. Put thepieces together. We know that thevice president is obsessed with adesire to attack Iran, and has beensince before he even took office.Bush has repeatedly stressed thatIran cannot be permitted to continuewith its nuclear processing (hecalls it their ""nukular"" bomb program,though there is no evidence thatthe country has a nuclear bombdevelopment program, and in fact thelast National Intelligence Estimateon Iran said there was not andhadn't been since 2003). And Fallon hasnow quit. The Eisenhowernuclear aircraft carrier strike forcehas departed for stationing offIran, joining forces already in placethere, and loaded to the brimwith strike aircraft, Tomahawk missiles,and even nuclear weapons. Itwas long ago reported that stealth bombershad been put in place income of the countries of the old Soviet Unionnorth of Iran, as well ason the island of Diego Garcia in the IndianOcean. All theelements, that is to say, are in place for amassive air assault onIranian targets, designed to destroy its nuclearprogram, cripple itsmilitary command and control, and--at least this isa stated Cheneygoal--to lead to the overthrow of the Iranian governmentby its ownpeople. It is, of course, the strategy of madmen. TheUShas no forces to send into Iran. All they can do is bomb it.Andbombing a country doesn't lead its people to rise up. It leads themtorally 'round the flag. Especially when the civilian casualties ofournot-so-""smart"" bombs start to soar. If such an attack weretohappen, we can kiss goodbye to six years of domestic peace, suchaswe've had. The Iranians have considerable capability to inflictdamageon US targets of interest, both overseas and here in the domesticUSusing assymetrical warfare techniques. The worse part is, they'dbecompletely justified in doing so, since any attack on them would beacrime against peace--the gravest of all international crimes. Americantroopsalready mired and pinned down in a war in Iraq, would findthemselvessuddenly under attack by Shia forces there, who for severalyears nowhave been largely leaving them alone. And oil, whichjust bumpedup against $110 a barrel, an all-time record, will doublein priceovernight, as the whole Persian Gulf becomes a war zone. Wecanexpect massive launches of small boats armed with missilesandtorpedoes, as well as sophisticated anti-ship missiles fromshorebatteries, all fired at US ships in the Gulf, and it wouldbeastounding if some or even many vessels of the US fleet weren't sunk. Meanwhile,tankertraffic in the Gulf, which accounts for 20% or more of theworld's oil,will cease as insurance rates for those vessels goesthrough the roof. Themonster of war will be unleashed, and willnot easily be defeated.That's why Adm. Fallon was so opposed to thewhole idea. He knows thatit will be a disaster for the US militarily,economically andpolitically. The worst part is that Cheneyknows this, too. Hejust doesn't care. This is the man's parting shotas he leavesoffice--to put the country into the throes of a war sovicious that noone will think of pursuing him for his long list ofcrimes against thenation and the Constitution. He isguessing--and he may beright--that the American public will,sheep-like as always, rally to thecause, with a new round of yellowmagnet ""ribbons"" on their cars. He ishoping--and he may be right--thatwar will be a boon for the candidacyof Republican John McCain and forembattled Republicans running forCongress. It's a kind of political Hail Mary.  Source",0

Well Henry Ford powered his first model T with hemp seed oil. Maybe our fucked up gov't could change the law about growing hemp.,0
"  Didn't know much about hemp, so I looked it up. Seems like we should allow it here!  Hemp (from Old English hÃ¦nep, see cannabis (etymology)) is the common name for plants of the entire family of Cannabis, although the term is often used to refer only to Cannabis strains cultivated for industrial (non-drug) use. Hemp is cultivated virtually everywhere in the world except for the United States, and its cultivation in western countries is growing steadily. For example, Canadian Hempseed exports surged 300% last year[citation needed]. China, and other eastern countries, never prohibited its cultivation and use it extensively.  Industrial hemp has thousands of potential uses, from paper to textiles to biodegradable plastics to health food to fuel but it has not been the great commercial success that the enthusiast hoped for in countries where it is legal to harvest. It is one of the fastest growing biomasses on the planet, and one of the earliest domesticated plants known. It also runs parallel with the ""Green Future"" objectives that are becoming increasingly popular. Hemp requires little to no pesticides, replenishes soil with nutrients and nitrogen, controls erosion of the topsoil, and produces lots of oxygen, considering how fast it grows. Furthermore, Hemp could be used to replace many potentially harmful products, such as tree paper (the process of which uses bleaches and other toxic chemicals, apart from contributing to deforestation), cosmetics (which often contain synthetic oils that can clog pores and provide little nutritional content for the skin), plastics (which are petroleum based and cannot decompose), and more.",0

"Iraqi PM Gives Basra Gunmen Ultimatum Rocket Attacks Hit Green Zone  By Sholnn Freeman and Sudarsan Raghavan Washington Post Foreign Service Wednesday, March 26, 2008; 11:39 AM    BAGHDAD, March 26 -- Clashes continued Wednesday between Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias in the southern city of Basra, as Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki laid down a deadline for gunmen to surrender and fresh rocket attacks hit Baghdad's Green Zone.  The U.S. Embassy in the Iraqi capital said that three Americans were badly hurt by the latest strikes in the Green Zone, a fortified area that houses the U.S. Embassy compound and the Iraqi government, according to the Associated Press. No further details were immediately available. Mortars and rockets have struck the Green Zone and other U.S. positions repeatedly since Sunday, with U.S. officials reporting 12 strikes Tuesday.  According to wire reports, as many as 55 people have died during the past two days in intense clashes that began in Basra as part of an Iraqi government crackdown on Shiite militias in the area, particularly the Mahdi Army of hard-line cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Violence subsequently spread to Shiite areas in Baghdad and other cities.  The operation in Basra won praise Tuesday from the White House, where spokeswoman Dana Perino referred to it as a ""brave decision"" by Maliki to assert Iraqi government control over an important port city that serves as the country's gateway to the Persian Gulf.  According to wire service reports, Maliki issued a statement giving gunmen in Basra three days to give up their weapons and renounce further violence. Those who don't, said a Maliki aide, will be targeted for arrest in the ongoing security operation.  Speaking about the Basra offensive, U.S. military spokesman Maj. Gen. Kevin Bergner said, ""Initial reports are that they are making progress."" But he cautioned that it was still too early to grade the success of the operation.  ""A large part of the determination will be the citizens of Basra and how they respond,"" Bergner said at a briefing Wednesday in the Green Zone. He said Iraq has moved an additional 2,000 troops to Basra. A British military spokesman said Tuesday that Iraqi police and military troops in the area total 16,700, including national policemen, special forces and military police.  Bergner called the rocket attacks against the Green Zone ""criminal activity"" and said U.S. weapons teams had stopped eight intended rocket attacks targeting the Green Zone and located a stockpile of the weapons.  Iraqi forces were backed by U.S. and British reconnaissance planes as they launched their Basra offensive, an operation aimed at breaking the power of politically backed gunmen in the city.  The fiercest fighting took place in Basra neighborhoods where Iraqi forces targeted members of Sadr's Mahdi Army, further risking the collapse of a cease-fire that Sadr declared last summer. His fighters' stand-down has been widely credited with helping curb violence throughout the country during the U.S. troop buildup known as the surge.  When the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker deliver a report card on the country before Congress next month, a key gauge of progress will be whether the Iraqi government and its security forces are prepared to take over as U.S. troops withdraw.  The offensive in Basra, an important test of that preparedness, was several weeks in the making. Altough it targets the Mahdi Army in particular, its goal is also to break the grip that other Shiite militias, criminal gangs and death squads hold upon the southern port city, the conduit for Iraq's oil exports. In recent weeks, the militias have often battled one another in the streets.  It was unclear why U.S. forces would take part in a broad armed challenge to Sadr and his thousands-strong militia on the eve of Petraeus's assessment, which the Bush administration has said would greatly influence its decision on whether to draw down troop levels.  But many Sadr followers view the offensive as the latest attempt by the United States and Sadr's Shiite rivals, who run Iraq's government, to take advantage of Sadr's cease-fire to weaken his movement politically ahead of provincial elections that could take place this year.  ""We are really scared,"" said Aahad Hamid, 27, a Basra University employee whose voice quivered on the phone as Iraqi attack helicopters flew over the city. ""We can hear the voice of the bullets.""  In a sign of the offensive's importance, Maliki flew to Basra on Monday to oversee operations.  By Tuesday evening, Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias had also clashed in the cities of Kut and Hilla, as well as outside Sadr's Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City. Dusk-to-dawn curfews were imposed on at least six cities in southern Iraq, police said.  In addition to resisting with arms, Sadr's movement led a labor strike for a second day in many parts of eastern and central Baghdad on Tuesday, demanding the release of Sadr's jailed followers and an end to Iraqi government raids. Sadrist leaders ordered stores to close and taxi and bus drivers to stop operations. Many neighborhoods turned into virtual ghost towns, their usually busy streets all but empty. Parents kept their children home from school.  Sadr, who imposed the cease-fire to improve his nationalist credentials and rein in his often unruly militia, is under immense pressure from senior loyalists to lift the cease-fire order. Two weeks ago, he issued a statement permitting the Mahdi Army to fire on U.S. and Iraqi forces in self-defense. Hazim al-Araji, a senior Sadr official in the southern holy city of Najaf, told reporters there that the cease-fire remains in place despite Tuesday's clashes.  Later, hundreds of Sadr followers took to the streets of Najaf, carrying Korans, Iraqi flags and olive branches. Calling Maliki ""the agent of Americans,"" they chanted: ""No, no occupation! No, no terrorism!""  ""The Iraqi army went to Basra under the pretext of imposing a security plan, but the fact is they are targeting Sadrists,"" said Haidar al-Jaberi, a Sadr official who joined the protest.  Violence has gripped Basra since December, when British troops handed over control of the province to the Iraqi government. A power struggle between the Mahdi Army and its main rival, the Badr Organization militia of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, has battered the city in recent months. Smaller Shiite militias are also taking part in the fighting.  Ahead of the offensive, the Iraqi government closed off land access to the city and imposed a nighttime curfew until further notice. The government ordered schools, institutes and universities to cancel classes from Tuesday through Thursday. Some residents said they had no time to stock up on food and clean water.  Residents also reported that sporadic clashes began in Basra early Tuesday morning in the neighborhoods of Hayania, Jubaila and Jumhuria, all known Sadr strongholds. In telephone interviews, they described seeing military vehicles, soldiers and policemen exchanging fire with gunmen. Television footage showed militiamen firing rocket-propelled grenades at Iraqi security forces; others attacked from rooftops with AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns and mortars.  As of Tuesday afternoon, 13 gunmen, three Iraqi policemen and six civilians had been killed, police said. Scores more were injured, and at least five military vehicles were set ablaze, according to police.  ""No one is on the street,"" said Mohammed Kadhim, who owns a clothing shop in the city center. As he spoke, gunfire could be heard in the background. ""I am not able to go out of my house.""  Kadhim added that one of his neighbors had been shot in the face and was in critical condition.  A total of 15,000 Iraqi military and police personnel were participating in the Basra operation, according to an adviser to Iraq's security forces who spoke by telephone. At one point in the conversation, a mortar shell landed near his building, he said. He paused to take time to check on his soldiers and examine his body for shrapnel.  ""It's a tough and difficult battle,"" he said, adding that his men were fighting Mahdi Army militias, criminal gangs and death squads.  The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters, said he expected the campaign to take a week to 10 days. ""No state can have two armies. It is either the Iraqi military or the Mahdi Army,"" he said.  Col. Bill Buckner, a U.S. military spokesman, said coalition forces were providing intelligence, surveillance and support aircraft. Maj. Tom Holloway, a British military spokesman, said British forces were standing by but were not involved in the crackdown. He also said the British and Americans were providing surveillance support from aircraft.  As the offensive progressed, violence broke out elsewhere in the country. In Baghdad's al-Amin neighborhood, Mahdi Army gunmen stormed two offices of the Dawa party, which Maliki heads, and clashed with guards there. Five Mahdi Army gunmen and two Dawa guards were killed, an Interior Ministry official said.  In Sadr City on Tuesday afternoon, Mahdi Army militiamen were manning checkpoints and directing traffic. The main police station was empty.  Abu Ali al-Fartousi, a Mahdi Army fighter, said a battle broke out in Sadr City at 10:30 p.m., with Mahdi fighters using machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to repel government forces. A U.S. military spokesman reported no word on any late-night fighting in Sadr City.  Lt. Col. Steven Stover, a U.S. military spokesman, said U.S. troops backed Iraqi security forces as they engaged with ""special groups criminal elements outside of Sadr City."" A U.S. soldier was killed about 5 p.m. in an attack near Baghdad's Adhamiyah district, the U.S. military said. He was not identified.  Special correspondents Zaid Sabah, Naseer Nouri, Dalya Hassan and K.I. Ibrahim in Baghdad, Saad Sarhan in Najaf, and Washington Post staff in Nasiriyah contributed to this report.

"I have noticed after reading some accounts from posters on these boards how much a priori reasoning has again imposed itself on the thinking of many people.  Some are equivocating who is the instigator/offender/offensive element and who is on the reactionary/defender element of this conflict.  Those who are skeptical of the surge and Iraqi progress contend that it is the Mahdi Army who is on the offensive, when in fact it is the opposite...the ISF is on the offensive to assert its control of the country.  Like it is said in the article above, there cannot be two militaries...it's either an Iraqi army or the Mahdi army.  Everyone who cares about the fate of the people in Iraq to live in a free society will put their chips and support behind the Iraqi army.  Who among the presidential candidates is most or least likely to do so?",0
"On the next episode of ""As Iraq Turns...""",0
That's very Machiavelian. Can't have another prince's army running amok in your territory.,0
  It's purely Machiavelian...during a cease-fire no less. It's a play out of the Prince playbook.,0
Within the next 4 months we'll all see just how meaningless the 'surge' was.,0
"All these things are great, but we are not allowed to chase them into Iran and fix the rest of the pack..",0
"  No. That's going too far. Expel them from Iraq, let someone else deal with them. All we have to do is get a secure Iraq for now. I think I under estimated the Iraqi government's... ruthless efficiency.",0
" I bet within the next 4 months we'll have almost no Mahdi Army left and Sadr will be captured/killed or ""studying and praying"", no politics. Remember, a few weeks ago he issued one statement saying that he wants ""to drop out of politics"", I think it won't take much time for us to see another similar declaration issued by him.. I just hope our guys will keep doing what they are doing now!..",0
I think he is reaching for an epiphany of non-violent protest. I wish him God's speed on that epiphany before the fighting gets worse.,0
" Maybe you are right, I think they won't get a warm welcome in Iran if they fail to keep Basra. The ISF need to seal the border completely and we are needed there to help them..",0
" It's possible, but I think it's more likely he fears losing his power in an all-out war with the ISF. He feels he could be defeated, so he's playing the non-violence card in a desperate attempt to maintain control.",0
  I don't care HOW he comes to the realization that sit ins are better than shooting rockets -- so long as he comes to it.,0
"  Oh no...that isn't our responsiblility.  What is our responsibility is to empower Iraq enough that if she wished to ""get into it"" she could.  That is still some time away, and I doubt the Iraqi or Iranian people want to relive the 80's.  But unless Iraq has a sabre to rattle, then she is at Iran's mercy.  We just looking to give a free Iraq a pretty nice sabre, that she'll hopefully never have to use.",0
" My guess is it's just delaying the inevitable. The ISF needs to prove they're in charge and I seriously doubt al-Sadr will stick with the non-violent approach if the ISF continues to crack down on the militias.  It would be nice if there was a non-violent solution, but I think that's unlikely to happen.",0
"  I strongly suspect Al-Sadr's self preservation instinct is going to kick in near the end of 72 hours if pressure mounts and the odds don't look in his favor. But, I'm an optimist. Glad they are planning for the worst, though.",0
 I hope you're right. We'll see...,0
   ewwww and pretty much.,0
 Not really...here's the 3 candidates for you...  Hillary wants to be President because she thinks it's her divine right. McCain wants to be President to keep our nation at perpetual war. Obama wants to be President because-no matter how naive it may seem-he actually thinks he can make a difference.  This is the first time since I've been able to vote that I've thought about sitting one out.,0
McCain still has an uphill battle regardless of who wins the Democratic nomination.,0
"   It depends on your perspective I think. If you are a conservative, yea, most definetly. If you are an independent....not so much. I personally don't think Obama is electable. Hillary will steal it if she has to.",0
   and we all know how accurate the polls are.,0
   Eh he will beat Hillary in a landslide but with Obama the election can be very close.,0
"  QFT.  S'up, civilian. Good to see you're still kickin.",0
"   Gawd, we're fucked.  :(",0
   Now you know why I don't vote. It's like this every 4 years. You could always waste your vote on Nader or Paul though.,0
   ROTFLMAO! Obama is a power hungry politician who has never had a real job other than running for office to get more power.  Get real.,0
   and Clinton isnt? What the fuck are you smoking?,0
   I vote and I will vote until the power is returned back to the states where it belongs.,0
This election never should have been this important. NEVER!!  10th Amendment anyone?,0
   If you vote locally alot more would get done. Voting nationally doesn't make any sense.,0
Re. Only in a dream.,0
   How about power to the people?,0
"   first of all we really don't have any constitutional ""right"" to vote for who is president in this country. the problem is that states (willingly) have lost their control and power over to the feds.",0
"   that's what the 10th amendment is.  if you are inferring a true democracy, then you are a fool to think that is an effective form of ""mob rule"" government.",0
    I want a direct democracy. Community makes the decisions and there is no authority. Sounds like a good plan to me. It is the only form of government that I can support as the people would actually get what they want.,0
"   Justin, that's a really poor idea. I've got to run out but when I get back I'll explain why if no one else has in the meantime.",0
   Please educate me. Anarchist Communism is the only form of government I'll ever support. I very much doubt you will tell me what I haven't been told before.   I feel sorry for de-railing this thread.,0
god save us all if the republicans get office once again,0

"If we are truly the greatest country in the entire fucking world, then why in fucking hell do we have republican controlled Supreme Court, which can influence who becomes president only if their is a tie in the presidential election as well as the fact that our free market is completely owned by big business.

If we are so free, then why do we have rendition to take suspected or compltely innocent Americans and locked them up and torture them in till the confessed to a crime they did not commit. This is the only beginning yet in mind is signals the end of the end as our nation is fixing to collaspe just like the Roman Empire.",0

"  Ok, finally someone with logic. To me socialism is better because you are born and you automatically know what the government and your place in your country. In capitalism when you are born your are fed lies or so be called truths which can remain true in till someone like Bush gets into office and changes those so called truths. Socialism only needs to be fair to the people to stay in controll. Capitalism needs a police force to monitor and to protect the free market so that no one gain absolute power over it. I think that is fair to say.",0

"  I believe a company has a right to make money; however, go over seas for cheap labor is wrong. If it cost more to make your products blame the gov. for inflation, then take action to lower costs by being innovated. To me thats sounds at least fair. Illegal immigrants not wanted. No help is wanted. If you want a job, then apply for a work vista. Do not cheat yourself or life.",0
"The following are the Justices on the Supreme Court and which president nominated them:  Chief Justice John Roberts - George W. Bush (considered to be more on the conservative end) Associate Justice John Paul Stevens - Gerald Ford (considered to be one of the more liberal members on the court) Associate Justice Antonin Scalia - Ronald Reagan (considered to be the most conservative on the court) Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy - Ronald Reagan (most moderate on the bench) Associate Justice David Souter - George H.W. Bush (votes with the liberal wing) Associate Justice Clarence Thomas - George H.W. Bush (votes with the conservative wing) Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg - Bill Clinton (one of the more liberal voting justices) Associate Justice Stephen Breyer - Bill Clinton (votes with the liberal wing) Associate Justice Samuel Alito - George W. Bush (considered to be more conservative)  Essentially, this is still a split court. You have 4 conservatives (Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito) and 4 liberals (Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer).  And then you have the swing vote in Kennedy.  Now please, explain to me how this Supreme Court is a ""Republican controlled Supreme Court.""",0
"Ok batman, you make a good point. So before I leave the country, what can we do to keep free market, fix the economy, fix the dollar, and over all fix mother liberty. what is the solution.",0
"  Back in 2000 it was a republican controlled supreme court, which of course changes from time to time. but still the point has been made. why does a suprem power possibly influened by one party or the other party make and decide who is to be in charge of our country. why not a re-vote or a boxing match. or something.",0
"  K. Now here is my stance on it all. I think if 1 is legal the other has to be. Simply because they are the same thing in concept: cheap labor for an advantage in a market, less input for the same output. I'm not necessarily for both, but i do think that if Companies can go offshore, then companies who can't afford to (Despite the industry) should be able to higher cheap labor.  The problem with socialism is that government controlling wages will lead to lack of effort because of the lack of benefits. Right now, people work hard and continue to work hard to work their way up that ladder, with socialism, you don't get the same kind of purpose, or drive, from the workers. What we have now, isn't a real capitalism because no matter what, the gov't still watches for monopolies and still regulates a base point in wages (minimum wages).  I would prefer a capitalistic market over a socialistic market any day of the week because it benefits the hard working man who strives to climb the ladder.",0
  hell if i knew then I would do something. i do not know. i do not know what to do in life. i just want to be free. not haveing to be enslaved or watch our mother liberyt by raped dried by those child-raping politicians who are destroying our beloved nation. what can we do?,0
  How do you know my name? THat is not listed. I do not even have it anywhere on thiis computer or my email address. holy shit you are from the government.,0
"  The Supreme Court is completely independent, and was designed that way. The only time that any partisanship has an influence is when the confirmations are taking place.  So tell me, how exactly can any President, party, or politician have ANY influence over a member in the Supreme Court? What can they do? The Justice is nominated for LIFE. What could any party or politician possibly offer to a sitting Supreme Court Justice, when that Justice has a guaranteed job no matter who's in power, and no matter what their decision is?  Think about the 2000 election for a second. What did the Justices who voted to stop the recount (let's remember that the case wasn't about the Supreme Court voting for one candidate or another....if you really think that, please reread the decision) have to gain from doing so? What motive could Justice Scalia and then Chief Justice Rehnquist possibly have in ensuring that one party or another, or one president or another, came to power? Do you know what would have happened to all the sitting ""conservative"" Justices if Gore had won instead? NOTHING. So how did the party have any influence over their decision?",0
To Seth: I looked up the 2000 supreme court judges and most of them were placed on the bench by republican presidents meaning that they swung towards bush. now the bench has some new people. but all in all one still must be weary of such a system. a system that can almost if given the power to do so or by themselves with the protection of the military decide who can live or die in this country by simple declarations. it is complicated. not one government or political system is perfect. i understand that.,0
  My point is my country is not perfect but is going to rapidly change in the blink of an eye and freedom here will die. And I am not too sure how to live life anymore? I sent you a message to your myspace page on a private matter. that will help clear my mind in what I want to do in life. because i am not too sure on how to live life or what too do.,0

  Our troops being stationed in other countries such as Germany and Japan have more to do with international economical matters than anything else. Withdrawing our forces from peaceful overseas assignments will cripple several national economies worldwide and cause an international economic crisis.,0
  facts?,0
"   Take a world economics class, then delve into the finer points of the Defense Budget. For example, the U.S. doesn't own any of the land in the countries it has forces stationed (peacefully or otherwise). The land is rented. In Germany money is paid to the German Government every time a military vehicle is driving off of the installation. The German Government is paid a fee every time a hole is dug on the military installation itself, too. Same thing with the use of the rifle range. Let's not even get into the millions of dollars spent every year by the troops themselves within the country (the alcohol purchase alone would fund a couple of social programs here in the U.S.).  When we first set up the airbase in Hungary in support of the Operation Joint Endeavor in 1995 we almost tripled two-thirds of the country's Gross National Product.  South Korea actually only pays about 20% of their defense budget; we handle the rest in accordance of their treaty. If we were to just up and leave, they'd have to make up that last 80% in the face of North Korea's ""million man army.""  Need more examples?",0
  i would like some sources,0
   That just sounds like one big bureaucracy to me. While foreign countries are profiting from the US bases; the National Debt goes up even further.  Do we really need that many bases overseas?,0

"Believe me, guys, I'm very much a ""take care of our own first"" kinda guy. I firmly believe we should withdraw all forces from overseas, peaceful or otherwise. I don't see the need for 14 active Aircraft Carriers plus escorts, either. I also hate the fact that so much of our own economy is tied up in the world market, as well as the fact that we pay out billions in foreign aid when we've got people starving in the streets.  I'm a staunch isolationist; always have been.  However, what I like and don't like doesn't change the facts. I'm willing to make the sacrifices necessary to withdraw into our shells and take care of ourselves first, but I can't make that choice for the rest of the country (which is why I will never run for office). What's good for me isn't always good for everyone else.",0

It's all about the pecking order, and the side effects of reliance - as opposed to independents. This also gets ""misconstrued"" as a forced feeling of inferiority, which is also unliked.

Uhmmmm... buddy, despite what the UN is and does (which, in case you didnt know, is a multi-national collaborative entity BTW and is not made up solely of the US), that doesn't discredit the world's general opinion about the US.  Especially when the UN says, ""No, you can't invade iraq"", and the US says ""Too bad, what are you going to do?"" Sicne that IS basically how it went down.  The US government does what it wants, regardless of what the UN wants. The US only ""abides"" by the UN when it's convenient for them. It's a big fucking joke. So don't try and back the US and opinion with the collaborative effors of the UN - because then you just end up looking like a complete jackass.",0

" Crap! That's scary!  Tens of Thousands Affected In 1996, Aslin requested his files (to which he was entitled under the Public Information Act) and learned for the first time how the authorities had justified the forced sterilizations. ""They termed us feeble-minded idiots, and wrote that our children would be like us or even worse,"" he declares. He was so infuriated at the insult that he filed suit against the state of Michigan, seeking compensation. His claim was turned down last March because the statute of limitations had expired. But Aslin intends to fight on. If a higher court accepts his appeal, the consequences could be far-reaching. For Fred Aslin and his siblings were not an isolated case.  From 1907 onward, at least 60,000 Americans were sterilized against their will. The legal basis for these forced sterilizations was provided by so-called eugenics laws. Most compulsory sterilizations occurred in the 1930s and '40s, but some states, such as Virginia, continued the practice until the late 1970s. Most of the victims were poor and members of minorities, and none of them received compensation, according to Paul Lombardo, professor of law and bioethics at the University of Virginia. A Strong Eugenics Movement in the USA It is not widely known that there was a strong eugenics movement not only in Germany, but in the USA as well. The doctrine, hatched in the second half of the 19th century, combined elements of social Darwinism with the Mendelian theory of heredity. Its advocates pushed for perfecting the human ""gene pool"" by influencing the reproductive process. Their ongoing attempts at achieving a ""perfect"" society included aggressive - and in the case of the Nazis, murderous - actions against marginal groups and minorities.  American scientists played a vanguard role in the eugenics movement, which also had its supporters in Scandinavia, Latin America and Japan. U.S. biologists like Charles B. Davenport and Harry H. Laughlin advocated keeping the ""Anglo-American race"" pure. Their premise was that most ailments, as well as such social problems as poverty and criminality, were hereditary in nature. Therefore persons with a ""good genetic makeup"" should be encouraged to have families, while ""inferior"" people of allegedly poor genetic stock should be prevented from reproducing. Among those people regarded as inferior were epileptics, manic-depressives, prostitutes, alcoholics, the homeless and criminals. Under the eugenics laws, people who came to the negative attention of the social authorities could be branded as ""feeble-minded"" by court order and legally forced to undergo steriliziation. A Model for the Nazis By the early 1930s, some 30 American states had adopted eugenics laws. Most of them were modeled after the law which Harry H. Laughlin had drafted for the state of Virginia in 1924. That legislation found emulators outside the United States too. For example, it served Germany's National Socialists as a model for their 1933 ""Law for Protection Against Genetically Defective Offspring,"" on the basis of which at least 400,000 men and women were forcibly sterilized. More than 200,000 handicapped or allegedly handicapped people were also murdered by the Nazis. The University of Heidelberg was apparently so grateful to eugenicist Laughlin that it awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1936 for his ""services on behalf of racial hygiene.""  In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of Virginia's sterilization law. This was followed by a swift rise in the number of forced sterilizations in the United States. American eugenicists also pushed for anti-immigration measures and stricter laws to prevent racially mixed marriages. In a speech to the U.S. Congress, Laughlin had argued that ""morally and intellectually inferior"" immigrants from eastern and southern Europe were polluting America's genetic potential. The 1924 Immigration Restriction Act reduced by two thirds the immigration quotas for people from those parts of Europe. In signing the new law, President Calvin Coolidge said: ""America must remain American."" Pseudo-Science at Universities For a time, the doctrine of eugenics exerted considerable influence on American society. Based largely on political and social prejudices, the pseudo-science was taught at schools and universities. Leading institutions, such as Harvard, Cornell and Columbia, offered courses in eugenics. Prominent industrialists like cornflakes magnate J. H. Kellogg supported the creation of eugenics groups and organizations. So-called fitter family contests were held at country fairs, with citizens parading their ""good genes."" Movies like ""The Black Stork"" propagated eugenic sterilization.  During the 1940s, however, the theory of eugenics came under increasing criticism because of its racial prejudices and its lack of scientific foundation. Most American sterilization laws were abandoned during the 1950s. In 1980, former psychiatric patients who had been forced into sterilization banded together for a class-action suit, demanding compensation from the state of Virginia. But a federal judge rejected their suit on the grounds that the U.S. Supreme Court had affirmed the constitutionality of sterilization back in 1927. That Supreme Court ruling was never fought, even in subsequent years. As a result, future damage claims have little prospect of success. And the victims of eugenic forced sterilization have no lobbying power to achieve out-of-court settlements.  Two current exhibits are attempting to shed light on this repressed chapter of American history. The Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, in cooperation with the Goethe Institute, is showing an exhibition of photographs and documents titled ""Polluting the Pure."" And the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, a genetics research institute in the state of New York, is featuring an online exhibit on the history of the American eugenics movement.* Between 1910 and 1940, the venerable Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory on Long Island housed the Eugenics Record Office, the central research facility of the American eugenics movement. Most of the exhibit's 1,200 documents come from its archives.  * http://vector.cshl.org/eugenics/",0

I've yet to hear a good reason for Reagan to deliver his initial campaign speech, repleat with overtones of states rights vs federal rights, in Philadelphia, MI, the exact town in which three civil rights workers were murdered in one of the 1960s' ugliest cases of racist violence.

That was part of the anger, to this day most of these places are still just as they were after the riots. In combination with the drugs that were imported into the cities by Regean to destroy the black pride movement, these things destroyed confidence and morale in the black community, causing them to blame the man.

"BUMP FOR UPDATE As I suspected, the ""Hillary raised $10 million online overnight"" report that the Washington Post ran with earlier today was too good to be true. I don't know if the mistake is the reporter's or if someone at Camp Hillary was spinning a bit too fast, but there's no way they raised that much since her win in Pennsylvania yesterday.  An email from Terry McAuliffe, Clinton campaign chairman, that I received three hours ago, says ""More than 50,000 people have contributed to the campaign for the very first time in the last 24 hours alone."" If 80% of Clinton's donations are from new givers, that implies a total number of about 60,000 donations. If we're very generous and assume an average donation of $100, which is high for first-time donors, that gives Clinton a current take of at most $6 million.  Reading the Post's report from its Trail blog, which was by Matthew Mosk, it looks like the over-spin came from Hassan Nemazee, a finance co-chair for Clinton and longtime Democratic fatcat. A Google search shows Nemazee fed the same line to Business Week, which cited him for the news that Clinton supposedly took in $10 million by 2pm this afternoon.  Why am I bothering to knock this particular claim down to size? Because 90% of politics is about perception, and if a campaign is perceived to be running out of money, or floating in money, that affects what other people will think and do about it. Internet-driven fundraising is an amazing thing, because the costs are so low and the speed so seemingly instantaneous. But anyone who reports on it should be careful to remember that the campaigns can easily hype these numbers, and by the time anyone checks for the truth it won't matter.  The same is true, by the way, for the Obama campaign, as Patrick Ruffini has shown that the Obama campaign's online widget showing its donor total has occasionally behaved in odd ways. The best solution to this problem of verifiability, and the lack thereof, would be real-time donation transparency, as was practiced by the Ron Paul campaign. Unfortunately, that's hardly likely from a major campaign any time soon.  [If you're reading this story because of a link from the HuffPost or Fark.com, I've updated my reporting here. It looks like Clinton did rake in $10M as of sometime late yesterday, based on a claimed total of 100,000 donations since Tuesday night.}",0
" White House: North Korea Assisted Syria On Nuclear Reactor Destroyed By Israel   White House: Syria Must 'Come Clean' About Nukes (2:27 min.)  Web Extra: U.S. Intel Video Cites N.K., Syria Link (11:50 min.)  Bush Administration Opens Up About Israeli Airstrike On Syrian Reactor WASHINGTON (CBS News) â The White House said Thursday that North Korea's secret work on anuclear reactor with Syria was ""a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the world,"" raising doubts aboutPyongyang's intention to carry through with a promised disclosure ofits nuclear activities.  Sevenmonths after Israel bombed the reactor, the White House broke itssilence and said North Korea assisted Syria's secret nuclear programand that the destroyed facility was not intended for ""peacefulpurposes.""  The disclosure could undermine six-party negotiationsto try to resolve the nuclear standoff with North Korea. The WhiteHouse issued a two-page statement after lawmakers were given detailsabout the reactor in a series of briefings on Capitol Hill. The WhiteHouse said the International Atomic Energy Agency also was beingbriefed on the intelligence.  While calling North Korea's nuclearassistance to Syria a ""dangerous manifestation"" of Pyongyang's nuclearweapons program and its proliferation activities, the U.S. said itremained committed to the talks.  The administration said that after the reactor was damaged beyond repair, Syria tried to bury evidence of its existence.  ""Thiscover-up only served to reinforce our confidence that this reactor wasnot intended for peaceful activities,"" White House press secretary DanaPerino said. ""The Syrian regime must come clean before the worldregarding its illicit nuclear activities.""  CIA Director MichaelHayden, Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell and NationalSecurity Adviser Stephen Hadley briefed lawmakers, who were shown avideo presentation of intelligence information that the administrationcontends establishes a strong link between North Korea's nuclearprogram and the bombed Syrian site. It included still photographs thatshowed a strong resemblance between specific features of the plant andthe one near Yongbyon.  According to officials familiar with thepresentation, it did not show moving images inside the facility or anyNorth Korean workers, but included photographs that depict similaritiesbetween the North Korean and Syrian reactor designs.  U.S.negotiators have been trying hard to close a deal in which North Koreawould admit to and give up all its nuclear activities in return forbeing taken off the list of countries that support terrorism, reportsCBS News national security correspondent David Martin.  But atthe same time, the administration had all the photos showing NorthKorea was secretly helping Syria build a reactor that could produceplutonium for nuclear weapons, adds Martin. The images include a photothat U.S. intelligence says shows the head of Syria's nuclear agencywith one of the North Koreans who was negotiating with the UnitedStates.  By making the photos public, Martin reports, the U.S. istelling North Korea: ""If you won't come clean, we'll come clean foryou.""  The Syrian nuclear reactor destroyed by Israeli jets waswithin weeks or months of being functional, a top U.S. official toldThe Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because of thesensitivity of the matter. The official said the facility was mostlycompleted but still needed significant testing before it could bedeclared operational.  No uranium, which is needed to fuel areactor, was evident at the site, a remote area of eastern Syria alongthe Euphrates River. But the U.S. official said the reactor was similarin design to a North Korean reactor at Yongbyon, which has in the pastproduced small amounts of plutonium, the marterial needed to makepowerful nuclear weapons.  Top members of the House IntelligenceCommittee said the reactor posed a serious threat of spreadingdangerous nuclear materials.  ""This is a serious proliferationissue, both for the Middle East and the countries that may be involvedin Asia,"" said Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich.  Hoekstra andIntelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, toldreporters after the closed meeting that they were angry that the Bushadministration had delayed briefing the full committee for eight months.  ""It'sbad management and terrible public policy to go for eight monthsknowing this was out there and then drop this in our laps six hoursbefore they go to the public,"" Hoekstra said.  President Bush'sfailure to keep Congress informed has created friction that may imperilcongressional support for Bush's policies toward North Korea and Syria,he said.  ""It totally breaks down any trust that you have betweenthe administration and Congress,"" Hoekstra said. ""I think it reallyjeopardizes any type of the agreement they may come up with"" regardingNorth Korea.  A senior administration said the White House wentpublc with the evidence now to prevent an even broader confrontation inthe Middle East region, reports CBS News White House correspondent MarkKnoller.  ""We feared that if knowledge of this event spread quickly Syria might feel greater pressure to react,"" the official said.  The White House also stressed that North Korea's assistance on the Syrian reactor was an issue of ""great international concern.""  ""Theconstruction of this reactor was a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the region and the world,"" Perino said inthe statement. ""This is particularly true because it was done covertlyand in violation of the very procedures designed to reassure the worldof the peaceful intent of nuclear activities.  ""The United Statescalls upon the international community to redouble our common effortsto ending these activities and preventing the spread of weapons of massdestruction in this critical region.""",0
"You mean like North Korea ""Came Clean""?",0
"Why come clean,, Iraq came clean with inspectors and they submitted every bit of evidence with a 1000 pages that it was not in pocession of WMDs, yet it was meaningless in the goal to invade the sovereign nation anyway. This come clean nonsense is all political rhedoric to appease stupid people who support policies of an aggressive preemtive nature and dont want the truth.",0
"I think the White House need to ""Come Clean"" about nukes first.",0
" Pete:  I have had discussions with one of the iraqi inspectors - who is fluent in Arabic. He is fluent enough that he gets paid to do translations. He is also a friend of a close friend.  He said that Iraq DID have WMD's, that they hid information, that they had spies int he inspection teams, that they knew when the inspectors were coming. Inspectors would be held up at one gate and could watch convoys of trucks leave at another gate.  The truth in Syria is that North Korea was working with Syria to build nukes - in contravention of their agreement with the U.S. not to do so in return for fuel supplies. That agreement was worked out by one Jimmy Carter under the auspices of the Clinton administration. The North Koreans later admitted that they violated the treaty from the very beginning.",0

It seems like a lot of movies coming out aren't quality.,0
 i might not listen to garbage but come on now she's hawt,0
Because they banned pens from insane people =]. And what's wrong with Garbage? They're a brilliant band - Infact my favourite lol!  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,0
Whst,0
Becuase Holly wood no longer knows how to write great movies that's why we get all these crappy insiderable remakes  Or has no one come to noticed this year's most anticipated movies and next years are all super hero based  2008  The Dark Knight Iron Man The Incredible Hulk Hell Boy 2  2009  Spiderman 3 Transformer 2 G.I Joe Friday the 13th (Remake) Child's Play (Remake) Tekken Dragon Ball  the list goes on,0
Friday the 13th (Remake) Child's Play (Remake) Tekken Dragon Ball  Those are probably gonna be hot garbage.,0
  lolz no that would be my first post,0
"  No they will be a load of Hyped Bullocks Garbage  Child's Play could work but what else can they do with it make it more scarier nada, just probably add more gore and CGI  Dragon Ball, do i hear a fan riot for making a white guy, Goku  Friday the 13th being produced by Michael Bay, juss gonna have more gore and under developed character background on Jason Voorhees as for Bay has poor developmental writing skills. Which will also be his flaw when he comes to produced and co-write 'A Nightmare On Elm St (2010).  Tekken automatically fails",0
because trash makes money,0
Because the younger generation have shitty taste in movies.,0
"  That's exactly it.  I'm actually kind of curious on Dave's comment.  Remakes equal easy money. Then again, the originals stand to earn money too. Remake comes out, then it makes people want to see the original. According to my list, 2009 stands to be a much bigger year than 2008. Incredible Hulk can suck a fat one. Even though it looks better than the last one, still looks like shit.",0
"They make crappy movies because you pay to see them. People payed money to see Meet the Spartans, Date movie, Epic Movie, etc... but nobody paid to see There Will Be Blood... so... which movies will the studio continue to produce?",0
"Define new?  2007 was one of the strongest years in recent memory.  2008 is off to a weak start.  Both of those have something to do with the writers strike, I think.  And yes, expand the horizons and stop watching what Hollywood wants you to watch. Also, while you're at it, turn off your FM radios and delete your MTVs. You'll thank me later.  Garbage does rock though...",0
"You mean, 2 bucks too many",0
" No, it's just because we the movie goers don't care to see originals therefore they don't get released everywhere, nor during the summer..  Box office shows that we prefer popcorn movies over movies that are really good like say, No Country for Old men, There will be blood, those movie didn't do a fraction of what that mess called Spider-man 3 did..  And like i said, we will just see how many of you that keep screaming for something original in hollywood, that will head out to watch The Strangers May 30th.. in fact how many of you have even bothered to rent The Orphanage?",0
"  Saw it at the theater... But it's not a Hollywood picture.  Which backs up my point, there were a LOT of good films released in 2007, it's up to you to track them down.",0
"Hollywood is seeing the Bollywood effect at the moment. The architect about how a movie comes to be made has changed drastically in Hollywood over the last decade. Churn out lots of movies and they only have to be ok in quality. Turn a modest profit at the box office because the B.O. is now a secondary revenue stream to the direct sell-through DVD, PPV, Foreign Distribution and cable TV markets.  Hollywood used to be a talent based industry -- Audiences would go see movies for the talent (actors; directors) even more than they do now. However, now it is a packaged goods industry on the studio side where talent takes a back seat to the movie itself (the high concept), and why marketing the movie is more important than anything else. A movie's main theatrical run is now just a 110 minute commercial for the eventual DVD release where it can make 10x its B.O. take.  Teens still go to the movies each weekend which throws a whole other dimension into the mix and is why most of the products offered cater to this demographic.  So... How does this explain movies just being not as good as the ones in previous years from a strictly business perspective?  The emphasis isn't on quality anymore. It's on quantity.  There will be 100 movies, big and small, coming out this summer of 2008. That's just a four month period (May-August). Consider how many movies come out PER YEAR (in the U.S.) and this is proof the focus is now on market saturation and not the quality of the product. Also, consider over half (50%) of those movies released each year are remakes and or based on previously proven properties like novels and comic books.  Studios can get away with this approach because a lot of these movies aren't made for very much, so when they do strike B.O. gold -- Like ""Juno"" -- They can maximize the profits.  Most of your smaller movies have budgets of less than $40 million which is why they can afford to fail at the B.O. because they will easily make that back through DVD rentals. These days, there are only a few, tent pole pictures studios are willing to sink a lot of money ($100-$300 million per picture) into. These are your franchise pictures like the household comic book movies, high concept stuff like ""Transformers"" etc. -- Properties that coincidentally also have cross-promotional tie-ins (toys, video games, fast food, cell phone, etc.) to help finance the films.  It is this emphasis on quantity that is effecting what is produced, movies don't have to be ""good"" anymore. They just have to be on the market and interest you in the DVD. Because once you buy or rent the DVD, even if the movie ""sucks"" you've already spent your money and that is what the studios and theater owners want.  But to say all movies are garbage this decade is pure idiocy. This decade has seen many future classics in their respected genres...from all around the world.",0
^Thats an article I found somewhere a few weeks back and saved it to my hard-drive. It saved me typing what I already knew though:),0
"In total...From a studio standpoint it's much easier to go with a sure thing and proven commodities/formulas than to risk allot of money an a ""personal original film"" from an artist(which can take years to create and make).",0

I mean the Viral marketing for The Dark Knight didn't begin until a year before it was due release to hit Cinema, when we saw that beautiful teaser revealing Ledger voice and laugh.",0
  its sitting next to me but i havent had time to watch it yet =(,0
Because too much thought is put on special effects and not enough on the scripts.,0
hmm.. idk interesting observation^,0
"Yes, a lot of new movies are garbage. A lot of old movies are also garbage. There has always been garbage and there will always be garbage. Still, some really good movies are being made. It's just that most people don't bother to go see them. Because they are FOREIGN. *shocking* That said, a lot of foreign films are also garbage. :lol:",0
"Because they are trying to sell tickets. Crap sells just as good as quality. Not as many, mind you if the project sucks, but it sells. In this corner we have Iron Man. In the other corner we have Never Back Down. Movies are not about artistic expression or character development and a good plot. It's about making whatever it is PG-13 so kids with money can go see it alone and spend that money on tickets.",0
" Exactly, and if you don't believe what he just said.. Just try giving New Line a call.. oh wait you can't, because they are now owned by WB, since that Failure called the Golden Compass tanked horribly.. even despite doing very, very well overseas it was still a 75% loss..",0
"  Actually it wasn't because of 'The Golden Compass.'  It was due to subsidary copyright issues concerning 'The Hobbit movie' they were sued by Tolkien Enterprises. In which the law suit fee was so high that New Line waived them self into Warner Bros, in New Line is a subsidary production unit of Time Warner. They have only done this until they recover enough cash to rebuild themselves",0
"Besides, The Golden Compass wasn't exactly what you'd call a bold, original new vision. Along with the LOTR series, the Narnia series, and The Spiderwick Chronicles, it was just one of many fantasy-adventure books being tapped by Hollywood.",0
"  True also the simple fact as well is that it stood for everything that Narnia was against lol. I mean Narnia was so christian style while Compass was atheist style in which even the God like character dies in the end.  In my opinion LOTR & Spiderwick were the best on that list, Compass was alright but that polar bear flew one mean right hook",0
"Since Obamas win the other night, the press has basically called him the winner...now I am an Obama supporter..however I do know that the press, cable news (fox news lol)..has done whatever they could to antagonize his aspirations.  so with that being said  does anyone think that Obama is being setup, calling him the winner, making Hillary the underdog  with the upcomming primaries, the hillary turnout could possibly be tremendous enough to put the spotlight back on her and give her momentum again. Afterall, they are still shy a few superdelegates to clinch the nomination. Giving her enough momentum into the following primaries to plead her case.   Does anyone else besides me think that is in the realm of possibility?",0
[Waits for Obamabots to flood in/],0
 *waits for the obsessive obama haters to flood in and fight with the obamabots*  Well one side is in already.,0
"Do you suffer from a persecution/victim complex?  Nobody is ""setting Obama up."" He has been a media darling for well over a year; since the 2004 Democratic convention, as a matter of fact. It takes a mighty thick tinfoil hat to believe the media is suddenly going to pull the rug out from under him in an effort to give Hillary the nomination.  They might drop the guillotine once the General Election campaign starts, but I honestly doubt they're writing Hillary's obituary as some sort of reverse-psychology to resurrect her campaign with ""underdog"" votes.  Fact is, Hillary is set to win West Virginia by double-figures and has maintained a 20% + lead in opinion polls there for months, well before any of the post-North Carolina ""Hillary is toast"" chatter.  She is also heavily favored to win Kentucky and Puerto Rico by double digits, but if she doesn't keep Oregon close the media will continue to declare Hillary dead in the water.",0
"  Oh, hah, hilarity in its finest. [sarcasm/]  The only time I debate with an Obamabot is if they're totally insane and radicalist, Dunkle, or they're totally wrong, every Obamabot, usually.",0
"   Hey Bob, what the hell is the Bush/Cheney avatar all about. You DO know that Bush and Cheney are the biggest mass murderers of the 21st century right? Hmmm...I think you should be banned just for having that avatar...but that's just me, and pretty much the rest of the world.",0
  And that is related to the topic of the thread how?,0
  LOL..typical paranoid Obamaniacs.,0
lol as a black man in america i embrace my paranoya...keeps me safe,0
  A good question to Obama supporters and especially the black voters. Would you support Hillary Clinton if she was chosen to be the nominee by the superdelegates?,0
"   i would vote for any democrat, i dont know anyone who hasnt been severely affected in a negative way by the bush agenda.....but i dont like killary at all and dont think she's trust worthy, but the lesser of the two evils",0
"It's pretty obvious they are going to try and play up her possible win West Virginia as the ""unexpected game changer"", now she just has to hope she has the momentum to do so.",0
"  You haven't been around politics long, son.Â  I'm a Ron Paul supporter and I say that's within the realm of possibility--all's fair in love, war, and politics, and that kind of thing's been done before.Â  Read history and learn something.",0
  Well that is a good example of a black voter taking control of the situation rather than being controlled by the situation. I just ask this question just in case it might turn out that way. I just hope black voters will still turn out for Hillary even though it has been a rough primary. Hillary really did not have a choice but to be on the offensive against Obama and throw the kitchen sink at him due to the fact that Obama did take her by surprise with overwhelming victories after Super Tuesday. But it is definitely in Obama's favor right now to be the nominee. Good luck to all candidate.,0
 She herself was heard to say that she could claim big momentum just by a sweep in Puerto Rico.  She's changed her metrics from popular vote to superdelegate count to Big Mo. She's desperate.,0
"She isn't in such a dire situation that she can't win especially since she's expected to win W.V. and Kentucky, it all comes down to how fast Obama can get more delegates despite it all. That's the real race going on at the moment.",0
"  Spoken like a true winner-take-all Republican. Sorry, kid, but Democrats don't work that way--their delegation is meted out proportionally.ÃÂ  In Indiana, she ""won"" 51% to 49% so she comes out at best, a single delegate more than Obama got in Indiana.  She's gotta win by at least 70% in ALL the remaining states just to break even.ÃÂ  70% ain't happening in either WV or KY.",0
"Maybe, but I'm not Republican. I was just trying to be fair to Hillary supporters. It isn't over. It's daunting, no doubt. I support Obama and think he is the best candidate and will win against McCain, just telling it like I see it.",0
"  A theory that holds as much water as the theory that Obama is a Republican mole, chosen as the perfect enemy to defeat Hillary (a charming black male vs. a bulldog white woman) back in 2004.  In other words, unlikely.",0
"  Thinking that Democrat primaries work like Republican primaries is being fair to Hillary supporters how, exactly?ÃÂ  The numbers aren't in her favor and that's why people are saying it's over.ÃÂ  She can go spend her war chest like a drunken sailor because it's her choice, but it's not smart.ÃÂ  And the more dumb things she does with her campaign and her money isn't going to make her look good in the next presidential election either.  If she wants to remain viable for the next election, she's gotta at least maintain the appearance of being smart.ÃÂ  This ain't it.",0
   theres no credance to obama being a republic mole though,0
  Please tell me you're joking.,0
"  There's no credence to your ""set up"" conspiracy either.",0
"  and as far as me bein a black man in america...if you havent walked in my shoes...dont worry about my paranoya factor   it is just that...a theory, but a theory based on facts. that hillary could possibly market her wins in the next two states as a comeback",0

Although I think there's too much attention paid to The Empire Strikes Back, which I do not view as a groundbreaking film, sorry.  Time Code is a cheap gimmick movie, and very hard to watch for more than 10 minutes.  Requiem for a Dream is not the first anti-drug movie.  And, as groundbreaking films go, where was Citizen Kane?  I would have also mentioned Metropolis, M, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, Anatomy of a Murder, Blade Runner, Rope, and several silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari & The Passion of Joan of Arc if I was talking about films with a notable influence years after they were made.",0

"A 70-year-old Israeli woman in the southern village of Yesha has been killed by a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, Israeli officials have said.  The rocket scored a direct hit on her house in the small farming community.  She is the second Israeli civilian to be killed by rocket or mortar fire from Gaza in less than a week.  The latest death comes as Egypt is trying to mediate a truce between Israel and Hamas, the militant Palestinian group which controls Gaza.  The head of Egyptian intelligence, Omar Suleiman, has been in Israel for talks with political leaders.  Last month the plans were given the backing of a dozen Palestinian factions including, Hamas - which has controlled Gaza since last year - and the Fatah movement of President Mahmoud Abbas.  Israel said any truce agreement must include the release of a captured Israeli soldier and an end to arms smuggling into Gaza.  The Israeli military launches frequent air strikes or incursions into Gaza in an attempt to stop the frequent rocket fire from the territory into southern Israel.  Mortar fire from Gaza killed an Israeli man on Friday in the kibbutz of Kfar Aza. Three people were wounded.  Israeli air strikes then killed five members of Hamas.  The Gaza Strip has been controlled by Hamas since last June when they ousted their rivals from the Fatah movement.   Story from BBC NEWS:",0

"   LMAO  Are you joking?  First off, Olmert's got a bad approval rating but doesn't quit. what am I supposed to do about it? assassinate him? grow up you turd. I voted for someone else (the Elders' party), won't vote for them again, and that's it.   now as for the US voting Dubyah in TWICE....   First off, both Gore and Kerry would have been better for the US and for the world. Hell, evenÃÂ  YOU would have made a better president (well, maybe not YOU but let's say... Shawn) In 20 years, Dubyah's gonna be recited in one breath with Hitler and Stalin and Mao, you dumbass... He's the worst thing that happened to the US since Vietnam  As if electing him once wasn't bad enough you actually were STUPID enough to repeat the same mistake TWICE... in a ROW...",0
"  Well you didn't vote for Olmert, that's big fact #1.  Conversely, something like 49.99999999999999999% of Americans didn't vote for Bush over Kerry.  Conversely, 50.0000112145246345645746734637% of Americans didn't vote for Bush over Gore.  So the ones who didn't vote for Bush are kind of in the same boat as you, with regards to unpopular leaders.",0
" I didn't say that you voted for Olmert.ÃÂ  No, you aren't supposed to assassinate Olmert. Or Livni.ÃÂ  All I said is that he is even more unpopular than Bush and Israel can't get rid of the sleeze.ÃÂ  He has too much protexia to give away to keep the Knesset from dumping him.  I only voted for Bush the second time.ÃÂ  The first time, I voted for Gore.ÃÂ   Gore and Kerry would have been worse than Bush - worse than Clinton even.ÃÂ  That is the opinion of the american public.ÃÂ  Obama would be a worldwide disaster as well.  Bush was a bad choice for president because:  * He can't speak off the cuff - a requirement for a national leader.  * He made Condi Rice Secretary of State.  * He hasn't released information on terrorism and the war in Iraq that would justify many of his actions.  The U.S. lost in Vietnam because the leftist press turned the country agaisnt the war, calling the Tet offensive a win for the NVA when it was a huge loss.ÃÂ  They are trying to do the same in Iraq.  If you want to know what is going on with the extreme left in the U.S., allow me to sendÃÂ you private messages.       To equate Bush with Hitler, Stalin and Mao is kind of nuts.",0
"  Well of course it is, but I'm saying that that other dude is blowing it wayy out of proportion. Its not like every country on earth is perfect.",0
  I agree it would be nuts to equate Bush with either. All three were in control and were all brutal dictators. Bush is just a poor sap who's letting himself be lead along by the likes of Cheney and Rummy and their business interests. It would also be interesting to see how Bush Snr's company has done since the launch of this war on terror.,0
"Sorry, Rob History aims its darts at the man on top",0
"  It does, and as much as I dislike Bush I can't give him credit for everything he does. I really do believe the real power is with the likes of Cheney and Rumsfeld, who were both major players in the Bush snr and Reagan admins.  If another Republican gets in and those two are still in the administration we won't see a change in presidency, just a different spokesman.",0
   Makes you wish Cheney actually killed that guy in the hunting accident... that would have been an odd way to die heroically for one's country...,0
"Newsflash, Rome failed too.",0
The rise and fall of nations. What goes up must come down.,0
"  Watch the video, it explains why Rome fell.",0
" Tisk Tisk...Rome didn't fail, it's still there, I've been there many times. The Roman Empire failed. ;)",0
"the government that governs best, governs not at all.",0
The video says that the Constitution is supposed to Govern the Government not the People.,0
  Rome went broke no?,0
Did anyone watch the video?  People are already making assumptions.  This is a great video on how this country is supposed to work.,0
"Rome fell because it spread itself too thin militarily, and it's economy started to collapse due to moving more and more to the left (more and more / larger government)...  Sound familiar?  AMAZING video by the way. One everyone should watch.",0
  Exactly  It really didnt have to fail they just had shit policies,0
  Haha what?,0
  ...  ... is there something wrong with you?,0
  Stop making their heads hurt,0
  The insanity is just too much in that post sorry.,0
   why was his post insane?  Speak now I demand it!,0
  Because Rome had one of the most significant (and earliest) examples of ancient free trade markets.,0
"  Yeah, and there are a lot of problems associated with that. I pretty much know how to eliminate it, but people think that'll never work.",0
"Okay... uhhh... I made no mention of free markets... I said their government moved more and mroe to the left... they instituted welfare programs, increased taxes, increased the size of the central government and so on. Productivity sank greatly... their economy suffered to an extreme extent... couple that with a military being spread so thin - and the barbarians had their way with them.  Oh and they debased the shit out of their currency.  Now how is everything I said ehre in any disagreement with what I said earlier?  Tyler, stop contributing your straw-man arguments to discussions in this forum - it's just annoying.",0
Like i said. Watch the video instead of assuming on what its about.,0
 And very little immigration control vandals and goths and huns.oh my!,0
" so mr knowledge, enlighten us to why the roman empire fell if it wasnt for financial collapse.",0
because of free trade... um....  okay? and you accuse others of insanity?,0
Bump  Everyone should watch this video to see how the US is supposed to be.,0
"The video is a rah rah rah for America...not much else. The breakdown is narrow sited and biased. The point that should be between the lines are the lines.  As to Rome, does anyone else give creedence to the theory that the lead in the aquaducts lead to a gradual dumbing down of the Roman population in general? Can't recall where I heard it, but it always struck me as an interesting thought.",0
"What does the Roman Empire have to do with the United States?  So what if they were a republic and they failed? That doesn't mean the US ever will. That's just a stupid argument. That's like saying . . . ""oh, Tommy went to college and failed all of his classes, and since Tommy failed, you are doomed to failure too""! Dumb dumb dumb.",0
" America won't be on top forever Nichols. It might not crash and burn, but it will fade into the background in time. Nothing lasts forever.  As far as Rome goes, its the first thing to jump out at alot of people when they hear the words ""empire"" or ""republic."" We could try comparisons to the Ottomans, but it wouldn't reach as broad an audience.",0
"  The reason they compared it to the US is because the Romans had about the same system of government a Republic. Less government, less taxes, the people were free. Later on the Roman politicians started asking for more people and more government bigger government, more taxes, spreading their empire. This caused a collapse of their economy and the Empire broke down. This is what happened to the United States and it might come crashing down just like the Roman Empire.",0
" No, I know why they compared it, but my point was that just because one thing fails, doesn't mean the other will.",0
"  ""untrue"".  It's a great video, very informative. I highly recommend it.",0
  Economically. It sure can. This is what we are facing today. We are $9.4 trillion in debt. If i'm not mistaken we are spending about $1trillion a year.,0
"LoL... we have over 50 TRILLION in additional debt coming as well. Social security is fucked. There's nothing there. Right now, our social security payments are goign right to the retired. That's fucked up. If it's there at all, that's not how the system was designed to work, and now we are digging ourselves into deeper and deeper debt.  You think 9.4 trillion is bad??? HAHAHAHAH... we've seen NOTHING YET.  Thank the lefties for the ""Unified Budget Act"" for that one... leftist policies FTL.",0
" ""Can"" and ""will"" have two completely different meanings.",0
" Lol, it's odd to see a righty from Boston! Good for you, man, for not succumbing to the left wing!",0
"  Did you see the ""is""?",0
"  Ugh, it's disgusting how far to the left this damned state is. You get taxed for spitting into the wind. This is why we call it ""Taxachusetts"". It's sooooo goddamned expensive to live here. I think there are so many lefties here because the vast majority of them are seriouslyÂ fiscally ignorant.  There has been SOME progress, though... literally within the last month they FINALLY enabled a free market system for car insurance. Before the whole system was absolutely HORRENDOUS. No lie, after Geico, Progressive, Allstate etc were allowed in, and government-regulated price fixing was abolished... I switched to Progressive and am saving (no lie) 1300 bucks a year.  Then again, Romney (a SUPPOSED conservative - BS if you ask me), uses leftist policies like FORCING everyone to get health insurance, otherwise you have to pay 200-900 dollars in additional state taxes when tax time comes around. He makes me sick. I always have health insurance, but that policy I find especially disgusting.",0
" Whew, I feel ya.",0

"Wow, I didnt know they were doing a movie on him....  well @ least the cast the right person for Condaleeza. They look quite similar.",0
   Thandie is waaaay hotter.,0
"   well yeah of course,Â cause shes an actress. so of course, I agree. They did a good job casting condalezza tho, im not sure any other well known actress that looks like her.",0

"This will flop big time. It's way to soon. We've seen the guy for 8 years, no one wants to sit through 2 hours of boredom about him.",0
"  Boredom? He's the most exciting vice president we've ever had! Name me another who was the brains behind the prez, who directed our wars, ensured that choice corporations would enjoy insane profits, and perhaps even orchestrated 9/11? But i'm guessing stone will probably spend too much time on cheney's daughter (wow, a lesbian in a reptpublican family!)",0
" Fuck off, liberal.",0
"Fuck off, dipshit.",0
"If you think that Bush orchestrated 9/11, then you're the dipshit.",0
"  I love how well you liberals use such, fancy big words to makeÂ your point!",0
It's not a very good one but here's a picture of Josh Brolin as George Bush  ,0
 close enough...I guess...Josh looks meaner that W,0
" I don't see how that's possible, considering that Bush caused 9/11. Josh would never do that.",0
 stop that...,0
I absolutely do not think that. It was the use of the word liberal as an insult. But I've already adressed that in another thread.,0
"Yeah. Like ""nucular"" option. :)",0
 You're as much a conspiracy theorist as anybody else,0
"Did Josh study history books of Ulysses S. Grant and Warren G. Harding like W did on the subject of ""unbelievably inept and abominable attempts of some men to completely f*ck up an entire nation as president"" ?",0
   No. And the word you should have used was independent. 'liberal' is a word for people who don't know who or why or what they're so angry for.,0
"  Hey, whadaya mean, f*ck up an entire nation? He's just living the american dream! You know, financing two wars with credit cards from china! For as much as has been spent in the wars, is how much the US will have to pay back to china, plus interest. This isn't pinko liberal faggity talk. This is money talk. Some dumbass who got the pulitzer prize in economics wrote a book saying this war is going to cost at least 3 trillion dollars (trillion is a word liberals like to use, 3 syllables). anyway, china will own the US, and bush still doesn't own Iraq, and the US soldiers who don't own their arms or legs or brains will be cared for, until they die, and that bill hasn't even started to come in yet. Wow, sounds like this could be a very interesting movie! Can't wait! I wonder if it will be as sick as the real thing.",0
  It will probably be PG-13 . . .ÃÂ  I don't really think so,0
"   whatever. Try to bully me out of watching Stone's movie, tough guy.",0
"   whoops, responded to the wrong post. anyway, I'm curious to see what stone will do with the material recent history has presented him, and hopefully will stir intelligent debate, rather than the shouting and name calling that is passed off as political discourse on FUX and CNN.",0
" Ah, so i bet you believe that Roosevelt had absolutely NO idea about Pearl harbor huh?  not saying Bush did or didn't have anything to do with his daddy's enemy for whom till this day we have no caught nor went after...  Also did we ever find the WMDs? you know the ones that were in the country that had Nothing to do with 9/11?  point is, You DON'T know he didn't just as we don't know he did, cause you are not in the office to know what goes on in the lying politicians doors..  THEY ALL LIE, so how do you even know what to believe?  he has his right to say Bush may have planned it, but in term you call him a name for his opinion, thats very American, no wonder why other countries hate us, hell we can't even like nor respect each other...unless we are being blown up",0
i see this thread becoming locked just as the Anti-Christian..  2 things that should never be discussed on non related boards to the topics..  Religion and Politics.. they are the same thing and lead to the same end result...,0
 And it's very black of you to get up on your soapbox and talk about America.  Wanna keep going? 'Cause I will.,0
" If it's something that makes Bush look silly, you can bet Stone will show it.",0
"this is what's wrong with Hollywood these days,they focus way too much on politics.I mean I hate Bush,but come on enough is enough.",0
"  As for the movie... I'm not really interested in seeing it. Stone hasn't made a film that's interested me since U-Turn. Yeah, that was hardly cinematic greatness but it was interesting.",0
" ah yes, the wise Internet slurs that would never be said to the face, because you my friend have figured out my secret you have won and i concede good sir..  here i make a statement that includes me, and you fire back with one that only includes my entire race.. good one;)",0
" I wouldn't have said it at all, but you went after Americans. Oh, and you also came to the defense of a liberal.",0
" once again i did INCLUDE myself as well being a American and all......cause i do things like that myself sometimes...  And i can care less if your a Liberal, Conservative, green party, Gay, Jew whatever, it doesn't matter to me because i don't live by labels, but it appears if you live in America you are forced to because that's just the way things are here.. I don't discriminate my discriminations, i attack any, all, and everyone. Sort of like South Park....",0

Really not all that different from his wife lol   ,0
"  (Main Stream Media)  that was sarcasm, BTW",0
  He just lost my vote.  dammit!,0
  Why? This is old news and has already been cleared up.  He did nothing wrong.,0
sarcasm dude. sarcasm.  lighten up.,0
   Agreed. I really don't have anything negative to say about either movie. DC/Warner Bros. really needs to give the reboot treatment to Superman like they did with Batman.,0
  I...  I like the old Batman movies.,0
"Superman (the original series)  I pick that because for its time, men... it had pretty good graphics.",0
"Batman-great Batman Returns-good, though there was some cheesy moments in the movie. Batman Forever-I liked it, though Two-Face should have done more then yelling about how the Bat won't die. Batman and Robin-total piece of crap",0
Batman begins far surpassed iron man on every level.,0
"  Agreed! I am hoping the same for the Dark Knight.. its my most anticipated movie for this year.. I love what bale, Nolan and the rest have done with the batman universe.",0
I can't imagine anything less than spectacular from them for this movie. i will be seeing it at midnight o the day it comes out and then in imax on the weekend.,0
i think we should fly to nolan's house in england and make him show it to us now.,0
me too man.. me too.. or anything that comes close to that strategy. Gotta see it as soon as possible .. and as much as possible..,0
Already ready your weapons. We're going to sail over there.,0
that's a good idea. that way when we finally get there it'll be ready to open anyway.  we can use my ship.  ,0
yea I figure then we wont actually have to hit nolan. Wait will all three of us fit in that? We may have to lighten the load.,0
"well, we're gonna need food. how attached are you to peter?",0
Batman Begins.,0
Not at all. He's totally expendable.,0

Batman,0
Superman is the best super hero ever hands downs,0
Batman... no one better.,0
Batman (as long as it's Michael Keaton),0
   WHAT he was lame and had no toughness behind his Batman...his Bruce was also shit,0
I thought he did a lot better than Kilmer or Clooney.,0
   he did but he still is not the best Batman...,0
"Maybe not, but he was sexier than the others ;-) LOL!",0
   How can a skinny almost bald can be sexier then this:    ,0
   Mamma mia! sop me up with a biscuit!,0
"   I like Superman movies to an extent, until they introduce comic relief. But going off what ERN said. They're real heros (Batman and Iron Man). Real human beings (not aliens from another world) that made themselves, their suits, their weapons, etc. etc. etc. That's pretty cool in a story sense. I found myself feeling like a kid again when I watched Iron Man as Tony Stark built his rocket flying ship (suit). ""MAN THAT WOULD BE COOL TO FLY LIKE THAT!"" :) is one thought I had :)",0
   seeing the 2nd picture make me miss the gym...  I need to get back in shape,0
"While I don't disagree the pics are nice, being sexy isn't all about looks. It's the attitude of knowing who you are, knowing that you're worth being known, being confident without cockiness. The way you carry yourself. It's about having a sense of humor and being able to laugh at yourself. Taking things in stride as they come....add all those together and the over all package improves tremendously!!",0
  It's amazing the lengths he goes through to prepare for a role..  ,0
   you need to read some of his interviews...,0
   yup and he gained like 60 pounds for Batman Begins wtf,0
Too Funny!!!!,0
"Superman = sucked worth watching if you are dead bored... Hulk = Worst movie I ever seen Ironman was decent I liked it , perfect actor for the part Batman is alright I still liked Keaton the best. Spiderman has the perfect actor for the part X men decent  Now megan fox as Wonder woman may be decent.",0
Ironman is a sweet rendition of the comic book heroe come to life without losing the flair of the character the second one will be totally off the charts : and stan lee is in heaven with the heffner cameo . bat man dark night is head to head they have finally found his best side and between the villans and his gadgets it is wild they were killing him before and it was so close to being like the tv version biff pow zapp crunch lol superman bit the dust dont see a comeback too bad too it was the 1st on the cutting edge too when it first came out,0
  Aaw maan.. and here I thought we were cool.. oh well.. N,0

"The Brazilian Job: the follow up to Paramountâs US remake of The Italian Job is still on the cards, and itâs got a 2009 release date marked. Jason Statham, Mos Def, Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are attached, as is director F Gary Gray.  I, Robot 2: All we know on this one is that itâs in the scripting stages still, with a potential 2010 release date planned in. No news on Mr Smith's involvement.  I Am Legend 2: Warnerâs huge Christmas 2007 hit could also have a follow up, although itâd be interesting to see if Will Smith returned to it. A 2010 release date is also being mooted for this one.  Rest of the list is located below.   www.icanspeel.com",0
Shrek 5? I didn't even know there was a fourth. X-D The last I saw was Shrek the Third. How could I missed Shrek 4?,0
"a scary movie 5....why ?????  plz stop the madness, it was cool when the 1st one came out but @ 5m i thinks its time to put this franchise to rest",0
  agreed!  i hope the silent hill sequel is superior to the first.,0
enough with the Saw's and Scary Movie sequels. Saw's aren't scary or gross and the Scary Movies havn't been funny since the 2nd one.,0
  Shrek 4 was announced ages ago but animated movies usually take a couple of years to make so I think it comes out next year. The films have been that successful that they don't need to wait to see if the latest film does well before announcing another sequel.  Judging by the amount of sequels planned it seems that Hollywood is playing it safe.,0
   I think it would be difficult for Mr. Smith to be in I Am Legend 2.,0
"  Yep, they should have went with the alternate ending if they wanted him for a sequel.",0
"This is going to be very interesting!!  Silent Hill in my opinion was all I expected in a movie.. i have never played the games, but knew alot about the story...wonder where they are going to take this sequel!  Ace Ventura 3: oh please no!!!  The People Under The Stairs 2: wonder what made them after all these years to finally make a part 2.  The Untouchables: looking forward to this one!  Thought I heard a couple of years ago about Ghostship 2 being in post production? guess i heard wrong!",0
every one of them a waste of film...maybe The Untouchables prequel about the rise of Capone will be good...,0
So it looks like Hillary will have to rely on Obama being assassinated in order to become president.,0
YES!,0
Which is why she shouldn't be on the ticket. Finally it's over.,0
I'm just glad that the Democrates actaully have a nominee now. And I'm glad it's Obama. Now the next thing that needs to happen is for him to become President. We don't need McCain. He is the biggest joke ever.,0
"Amazing! Wow!  We're just months away from having a black president, never thought I'd see it in my lifetime!",0
really sad that the delegates chose the wrong democrat.  sad day indeed.,0
"  The American people chose Obama. And don't come here giving me that ""Hillary had the popular vote"" bullshit. The only reason she had slightly more popular votes then Obama was because his name wasn't on the ballot in Michigan when hers was. lol@Clinton and her dumb supporters wanting those votes to count.",0
"Actually, It was Obama who pulled his name from the Michigan ballot, so that's his problem for not getting the count in that state. Michigan just did what he asked. Its his fault for pulling his name.  This is why election reform needs to be done. do what the republicans do, just get the votes and be done with it. none of this ""delegates"" and ""super delegates"" bull.",0
"Also to add, if Clinton does vie for the VP position, then that will be a better choice for the Democrats; Obama needs to stop being a pussy when it comes to illegal immigration.",0
"It's time for a change. Plus it's not like Obama is going to be a bad President, I would have been fine with Clinton. It's McCain we have to worry about. If he become President we are in a world of shit. Obama is going to be a great President. Time will prove that.",0
"   There was no point to leave the names on the ballots since the states were stripped of all its delegates to the national convention for breaking party rules by moving its primary to before February 5. All candidates abided by an agreement not to campaign in Florida, and all major candidates except for Hillary Clinton had removed their names from the Michigan ballot.",0
  What do you think is gonna happen with the immigration issue? Do you think 12-15 million illegals are gonna be deported? There's no way thats gonna happen. Mass deportations are out of the picture so its time to look at comprehensive immigration reform.,0
MSNBC is still reporting he needs 11 delegates?,0
"  Different news sources have different counts. The ""AP"" is the one reporting it officially for Obama.",0
  okay. thanks.,0
 Or does it?   http://noquarterusa.net/blog/2008/06/03/a-devastating-bombshell- on-obama-will-be-dropped-tomorrow/,0

"   so what? its still a primary; where the people of that state had a voice and the option to vote. Again, please point out why its Michigan's fault for not putting Obama's name on the ballot, when HE asked them to take his name off?  sorry, but its Obama's fault for pulling his name. An election is an election, no matter if the votes for the DELEGATE count matters or not.  Again, if the democrats would abolish this stupid ""delegate"" system, you wouldn't be using this poor excuse.",0
"   Has to do with some video of Michelle Obama speaking somewhere. The republicans want to use it as a ""nail"" in Obama's campaign to discredit him.",0
America just died more. =( I'm not voting now.,0
"Just as you don't vote for McCain, we should be fine.",0
there's still a chance clinton will take it to the convention.,0
"Call my opinion sexist if you will, I just don't feel a woman would be able to get repect from some countries. I like Clinton's views. But I don't think it will work.  And this is where everyone starts to hate me....",0
  coming from the republicans. this would not be at all surprising.,0
fuck that nigger america is fucked with all of the canidates that are running but we still have one hope MCAIN!!!!!,0
lol both hillary and obama speaking at aipac tomorrow and she wants to have a private sitdown meeting with him. haha...per andrea mitchell.,0
  x2... but I really think you cant count out McCain just yet.,0
  this is inappropriate.,0
no we are fucked because he is antiamerican has nothing to do with his races,0
"Yea, he's anti-American. Okay. That is just as ignorant as the racist comment.",0
"  Because Clinton, Edwards, and Obama where all supposed to do that. Than Clinton ""changed her mind"".",0
you cant count out mcain cause all of hilarys voters are going to vote for him just so it is not obama think about it....,0
mrs obama does look a bit nervous. and he's looking a little disturbed. fwiw,0
"Well, then it looks like McCain will definitely win then. And for the comment about how some countries wouldn't respect Hilary as being our president, what sheesha have you been smoking? There are third world countries that are more culturally ahead of us in respecting a woman leader. A woman president would actually help US ratings than a black president.",0
The racist negroes have a president nominee. I hope they are friggen happy now.,0
he will never be voted in with his past,0

"Tue Jun 3, 5:00 PM ET    OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. soldiers who have deserted the military because of the war in Iraq should be allowed to stay permanently in Canada, the House of Commons voted in a nonbinding motion on Tuesday.  ADVERTISEMENT  The three opposition parties, which together hold a majority of seats in the House, backed a motion that said the government should allow conscientious objectors and their families ""who have refused or left military service related to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations"" to stay in Canada.  Canada was a haven for tens of thousands of draft dodgers during the Vietnam War and has attracted an estimated 175 to 200 Americans who are resisting the Iraq conflict.  ""I think Canada has always been a place which has welcomed those who seek peace and seek freedom,"" Bob Rae, foreign affairs spokesman for the main opposition Liberal Party, told reporters outside the Commons after the vote.  The minority Conservative government opposes the idea, arguing that, unlike during the Vietnam War, the current U.S. military is composed of volunteers, and also that Washington allows people to apply for conscientious objector status.  ""People do not join with their eyes closed. If they do, then they have their own problems,"" Conservative Member of Parliament Laurie Hawn, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Canadian Air Force, said during debate on the motion.  The Supreme Court of Canada refused last November to hear appeals of two U.S. deserters whose applications for refugee status had been turned down by immigration authorities.

"  Â  An American who has decided to keep his nose out of Canada's internal affairs? I'll be blinkered! Well, there is always a first time.",0
 you thinking so does not make something so. and your country welcomed them. so...,0
"  ÃÂ  Sweetie, Canada did not welcome them. We originally wanted them gone, until libtard fruitcakes crashed the party and demanded the Canadian government allow them to stay.",0
"  Hey, if they come back to the States, then throw the book at them. When they're not, it's just not worth fighting with friendly nations about. They're already suffering by not being able to come home to their families, and by being ostracized by everybody who knows them for running off to Canada when things got too rough for them.",0
  ok. your government welcomed them. damn libtards are everywhere!,0
"  I remember when I was a lad, writing letters to my represenatives so that they can fix the problem.  Oh, where did those days go?",0

"  ÃÂ  No, even our libtard government wanted them to leave. It was their equally libtarded voters who demanded the cowards be allowed to remain on my soil.",0
"  ÃÂ  I neither want your deserters, nor your Mexicans. The moment Mexicans start to trickle through our border, I suggest it is time to retrieve our troops from Afghanistan, and have them shoot any of the fuckers attempting to make the mess of our country that they have of yours. Not going to happen on my watch. I am already working towards getting Muslims booted out of Canada since a few of their own were spying on one of our nuclear power plants with the sole intention of bombing it.",0

"  Did you know that the first wave of draft deserters during the Vietnam War that settled in Canada shifted the country's politcs a few odd points left.  Granted, the times and demographics are different and the number of deserters is a miniscule fraction of the first wave but after the Babylonian clusterfuck (Iraq War) is done away with, it'll be interesting to see how many draft-dodgers choose to stay in Canada.  Also, if they'll ever be pardoned for deserting like what Carter did after Nam.",0
"  ÃÂ  Absolutely untrue. Canada was leftist long before the arrival of Vietnam War draft dodgers. Canada was barely aware of socialism until American 'farmers' moved into Canada to get away from growing conservatism in the USA. Canada has become 'leftist' thanks to the import of Americans, but not draft-dodgers. The reason the draft-dodgers were even allowed to stay would be thanks to the fact Canada was already leftist. Their presence did nothing to Canadian politics. Canadians were being called 'commies' long before the Vietnam War.",0
"   I agree with the premise, but think about this for a second...  If your commander-in-chief is more than willing to toss you (you = the average deserter) in the brig on a whim any time an Iraqi cries ""wolf"" without so much as a trial...Haditha comes to mind.",0
"its a win win all the way around if they keep them Great for us, if they boot them back to the US they get arested for Deserting even better for us.",0
"  Oh don't say that, the Mexicans will just come to Canada to do the jobs the lazy Canadians won't do...lol",0
"   It's my country too and I say let them stay as long as they are productive and don't break any laws. It's so easy for some people to call someone a coward, when they themselves sit on their easy chair and pontificate about war and other races/religions that they know next to nothing about. They have never fought in a war or even been in the military yet deem to know it all. Till you have faced the stress and horror of war, how do you know how it would affect even you? I would suspect that the ones that have come across our border to stay had no idea that they would be fighting an illegal war and coming here is their only way out.  I remember the wave that came during the Vietnam war and met some that came to BC. They were broken and suffering men that couldn't even talk of the horrors they had seen. So, till you've experienced what they have you certainly can't judge them.",0
"  agreed. I enlisted knowing full well that I may be called upon to do things i didnt want to do.  That i may have to go into combat and be killed.  My son currently is srving. He enlisted with the same foreknowledge.  There is no draft. enlistment is NOT mandatory. If you dont want to uphold the oath you must take to enlist, DONT ENLIST. No one forced them to enter the service.  To most people who are clueless about war, there is NO children. There is NO Women.  When compassion enters into it, you DIE. you team members DIE.  You are no less dead from being shot by a 10 year old then you are from anyone else. WE learned that lesson well in vietnam. 5 year olds walk into a group of GI's and detonate a grenade becuase the ""enemy"" taught them to.  I woudl have to disagree with some of the IRAQ ""vets"" howver who claim you are tuaght to kill everything if you recieve fire. This is catergorically incorrect. just as law enforcement are taught to identify threats so are soldiers taught to do the same. You aim a weapon at me, I kill you . you are a woman walking by someone with a weapon shooting at me I DONT shoot her. some people are idiots.",0
Do you honestly think President Bush and President Clinton and their appointed ones haven't tried talking to these governments? Maybe you should be reading more history books rather than biographies. LOL,0

"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080610/wl_afp/europeinflationprote stenergytransport  Two truck drivers killed as fuel strike hits hard in Europe  by Olivier Thibault 2 hours, 15 minutes ago  MADRID (AFP) - Two truck drivers were killed on picket lines in Spain and Portugal on Tuesday as strikes by hauliers over soaring fuel prices turned increasingly ugly.    Spanish police escorted petrol tankers into Barcelona as the stoppage, launched Monday, caused food and fuel shortages and huge tailbacks on the Spanish-French border. French railway workers began their own walkout, increasing the transport chaos. A Portuguese driver was killed after he was hit by a truck as he manned a barricade filtering traffic near Alcanena, north of Lisbon. A police spokesman quoted witnesses as saying the 52-year-old man climbed onto the side of a truck in a bid to stop it and fell off under the wheels, Lusa news agency reported. Later Tuesday, a truck driver in southern Spain was run over and killed by a van as he was working on a picket line outside a wholesale market in the southern city of Granada, police said. Other trucks in Portugal and Spain have been stoned or had their windows smashed and tyres punctured for working during the national strikes. Tens of thousands of truckers are on strike or joining the protests to demand government help to offset the higher fuel costs. While new talks with trucker representatives were held in Madrid, authorities in northern Spain ordered emergency measures after many petrol stations in the Catalonia region ran out of fuel. ""Twenty tanker trucks escorted by the regional police left an industrial zone this morning for Barcelona port to help supply and distribute to petrol stations in the region,"" a regional police spokesman told AFP. Forty percent of petrol stations in Catalonia have run out of fuel, according to Manuel Amado, president of the Catalonia Federation of Service Stations. Arrivals of fresh meat, fish and fruit in Madrid have come to a near halt, according to officials at the Mercamadrid market, Spain's biggest wholesale market. They said that fish would be in short supply from Thursday but stocks of other foods should last until the end of the week. Automakers in Spain said most of the country's automobile plants, including those of Nissan, Mercedes Benz, Seat and Renault, have had to cut or halt production. Auto plants are particularly vulnerable to a strike by hauliers, which provide them with spare parts. Truckers stopped lorries from crossing the French-Spain border and caused major tailbacks around major Spanish cities, including Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. Spanish and French truckers staged pickets on either side of the frontier between the two countries. They blocked a bridge on the border at Bidassoa in the western Basque region and other main crossing points. On the French side, service areas on motorways were packed with trucks from the border right back to Bordeaux, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) away. Spain's second largest hauliers' union Fenadismer, which claims to represent 70,000 out of Spain's 380,000 truck drivers, launched an open-ended strike on Monday. Talks Monday between the hauliers and the government ended in failure, Fenadismer said. The Portuguese government said it hoped to have an agreement with its truckers by the end of the week. A separate strike by workers at the French rail company, SNCF, severely hit rail traffic. About half of intercity and local commuter trains were running along with about three quarters of TGV high speed trains from Paris to southwest France. Some express commuter lines into Paris were badly affected by the strike. Spanish fisherman were keeping up their strike against fuel prices but most French trawlers have decided to go back to work after several weeks of blocking ports and access to oil refineries.",0

"Since fuel costs about twice as much in Europe as in the U.S., since oil has a world-wide price and the cost of refining is about the same everywhere, the difference is taxes.

And if you think prices are high now, just wait until Iran gets their nukes working (something that I notice the leftists think they should do.)",0

"Thing is, the entire time the 'socialist' Europeans have been taxing oil, they have been using that money to build one of the greatest public transport networks imaginable. So for your average joe it ain't going to be that hard to get around, but for the haulage industry it has been hard, as their petrol 'allowance' probably hasn't gone up.  This is has really got me excited, with rising fuel prices, world food shortage and the domestic economy, it seems like the shits hitting the fan hard. I am going to enjoy the next five years.",0
"the public bus system is shit where I live. We have two buses a day come through where I live, and they expect me to give up my car.  The buses are normally empty, the only reason that they have about 5 people on them is because they give free bus passes to old people (like my mum).  Public transport in Britain is shite.",0

If someone dies after there lead to believe they were healed and then nolonger want to a doctor for treatment then later died. Should the faith healer be held accountable?How about if its a child should the healer be charged or a the parents?,0
no. and no.,0
"all of the above, charge them all",0
nah. gotta give natural selection a chance.,0
Under many states' laws they already are accountable. At least in the second case.,0
 what if ur a well know healer like Benny Hinn where he works world wide and people have dead and yet he still is able to preach.I say aleast been them from preaching in this country.,0
"  while at one time im sure i would have wholeheartedly agreed, the entire point, the gift if you would of being human, an opposible thumb aside, is the capacity to through intellect and foresight free ourselves from the brutal bondage and base nature of the darwinist design weve clung to for so long as unwaivering truth, as though we as a species who have already overcome so much and already disproven so many preconcieved truths were for some reason incapable of doing so...  it is our duty to help the ""stupid""lol....for we were once ""stupid"" too",0
"  okay, darwin didn't work. how about taking responsibility for your own actions and dumbass decisions? (i'm torn on the child issue...)",0
"well it is a whole cult issue, but it is the person's choice to not want medical treatment, unless they were brainwashed by set cult or person, but it really depends on the situation before one can really judge if it's right or wrong",0
" I dont think u can call fellowers of Benny Hinn a cult, u has milliond of believers in america alot.How many cult leaders are on cable tv like he is.",0
"it's their choice. if he doesn't come through for them, oh well.",0

" disease like cancer or ms only go into remission doctors never say ur cured just that ur currently cancer free or whatever.

But the bible says anythiing is possiabel with god, there the big differenc.",0
  on that logic there is no reason euthanasia should be illegal,0
"Absolutely not. Health care is a personal choice. People die in hospitals all the time. If your beliefs are not main stream its your choice. Nobody has the right to force an adult into any treatment. Minors are a different story but even then they should have control of choice before 18. We had a kid with some type of cancer here who refused traditional care and his parentsd supported him. I think he was around 16 at the time the court battles started. After a few court battles he won his case and is still alive. It could have killed him but he had the right, its his body. Dont even try to tell I have to follow traditional medical procedures. My body, my choice.",0
"My body, my choice.  i agree 100%, and even as a non pot smoker, the strongest argument for its medicinal use",0
"  It's the 'healers' fault if the healer guarantees results, which they often do. In the doctor case, then, yes, they are sued for malpractice. And no doctor will guarentee results. And, while the scientific community often makes mistakes, they do have that whole scientific method thingy. If a doctor lies to you, yes, he's held accountable. A faith healer will lie to you when they say ""my system brings results"".",0
"  I agree here, absolutely. As long as the faith healer, aromatic therapist, etc gives you all the information so you can make the best choice.",0
"Yes, three posts in a row, sorry!  I want to amend my last post... as long as the healer doesn't make any false promises.",0
"all religions are cults, and they been brainwashing people for generations...some worse than others but in the end it all comes down to who has the bigger lies, it's like politics hehe",0

 the topic was about should or could crimanial charges be place aganist a faith healer who is also a pastor.Just becauae ur a pastors doesnt mean u can con the people and get away with it.,0
 if a faith healer is a pastor of a mega church like Benny Hinm or there some street corner con artist healer should they be treated any different.,0
 No. Its personal choice. Your health unless it effects society (as in something highly contagious) is a personal decision. It doesnt matter if you base your chgoice on a fortune cookie. Its your life.,0
"   No, no, no...that's not how these tele-evangelists get 100 million bones in the bank and still have the nerve to ask for donations for $36 million Gulfstream jets that cost $6000/month to maintain.  It's the stupid message of ""Give a bunch of money to my ministry and you will be just as rich in return!""  The church I used to go to, which to me was quite unlistenable as the pastor's only message was about he got shot and he's now prosperous as the congregation helped him put a huge downpyment on a Lexus, was nothing but a pit stop for donations.  This was Jesse Duplantis--in trouble with eyeballers of ministry finances all over--message EVERY TIME I begrudgingly saw him.ÃÂ   ""Everyone...stand up!""  ""If you are debt-free....sit down!""  ""Everyone else that's standing...if you want to be rich and prosper...BUY MY BOOKS!""ÃÂ  (WTF???)  After that, it was a bunch of stupid jokes that I'd heard before.  I never had the money to give and I never got the ""you're blessed by what you give"" mantra, because that's just wrong quite frankly, but at least my parents stopped this donation crap once I let them in on the ponzi scheme run by many of these big shots.  Benny Hinn's skank daughter gets a senior summer trip from donations...that was their sign to stop.  It's people's greed on both sides, that's all there is to that.",0
 Are you kidding? IN a religious fanatic/anti-science society like the US?  Fat chance... That's like trying to sue the US government.,0
I think if there where a statue that has criminalized stupidity in some way thereÃ¢â¬â¢s an avenue for prosecution aside from that no.  PS DonÃ¢â¬â¢t buy a Benny Hinn CD the hole heals up in a week and all youÃ¢â¬â¢re left with is a shiny $14.99 coaster.,0

"Breaking News >> Supreme Court Says Individuals Have Right to Own Guns, Strikes Down D.C. Handgun Ban",0
"http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=343&sid=1429208  Supreme Court says Americans have right to guns By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court says Americans have a right to own guns for self-defense and hunting, the justices' first major pronouncement on gun rights in U.S. history.  The court's 5-4 ruling strikes down the District of Columbia's 32-year-old ban on handguns as incompatible with gun rights under the Second Amendment. The decision goes further than even the Bush administration wanted, but probably leaves most firearms laws intact.  The court had not conclusively interpreted the Second Amendment since its ratification in 1791. The amendment reads: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""  The basic issue for the justices was whether the amendment protects an individual's right to own guns no matter what, or whether that right is somehow tied to service in a state militia.   (Copyright 2008 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)",0
  So does the Constitution. Thank god the SC can see that.,0
"  at heart, americans kinda like to kill each other so there are two things you'll never see, a ban on guns or a ban ..ion. so get over it and move on to things you can actually do something about, raising the standard of living for all americans, better education, including sex education, better jobs, etc.  those things will have more impact on the death toll than banning guns or abortion.",0

I don't really see how this is breaking news - our constitution has been saying the same exact thing since 1789.,0

Yep... the purpose is for the people to be able to REMOVE the people from office by force if they overstep thier constitutional powers.  By the ORIGINAL meaning... we should be allowed to buy fully operational M1 Abrams tanks if we want to.,0

It doesn't look bad, but from the trailer it looks like they were lieing when they said that it wasn't going to be a movie that involved the big ""governmant conspiracy"" that the show more or less was built around in the last half of the series.

Also it worked brilliantly as a tv series, with the interaction between Mulder and Scully. However it doesn't work as an action packed thriller.",0
" I agree, I watched the show way back but a new movie just doesn't interest me.",0
"I liked it all the way until the end. I just hated how the series ended. It was about as enlightening as The Matrix 3 as far as answering questions. I even liked Robert Patrick in there. I felt like he gave us a break from the mystical deep sci fi stuff. Too much of the Sci Fi Conspiracy got to thick. When they put Robert Patrick in there as the real down to earth dude thinking, ""HAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE, YOU PEOPLE ARE NUTS"" I thought that was kind of cool. Plus I just like Robert Patrick.",0
I have to agree with you guys about not really caring.The TV series was good for awhile but it got boring and the first movie was a stinker.They'll have to do something spectacular or I'll wait til it comes on cable for free.,0
"I meant to say the mythology, but that was my point. It looks as if Connaelly is bleeding that black tar crap from his eyes at one point, and there is a shot at the end that looked as if someone was in a cocoon of gunk or whatever they called it when Scully was put in one at the end of the first movie. I hope this all has something to do with some monster or other wordly event that has nothing to do with the ""alien conspiracy"", because those were the best episodes, IMO. But the images that I mentioned seemed to close to the first movie for comfort.",0
"I don't know. I liked it all. Alien and Monster. I thought the black stuff was dealing with the Alien conspiracy. I didn't feel they answered that enough and left the viewers still asking questions at the end. It would be cool if they made another movie not for theaters, but for TV. One that would answer all the questions.  This same thing is going to happen with LOST, I know it. People are going to still have questions after the show. Then later they'll revamp it into a movie. And people will react to it in the same way they're reacting to X-Files :)  MARK MY WORDS!!!!  *SHAKING FIST IN THE AIR*",0
"A lot of the alien stories were great. It's just when they started showing the smoking man in these meetings a bunch old millionaires that supposedlt controlled the government that it started to annoy me. It got to the point that whenevr that guy showed up, I tuned out. But they made some damn creepy monster episodes that are still great. That is what I am hoping for with this movie.",0
Im looking forward to seeing the new movie even though i would rather see the movie deal with the shows mythology.,0
"I'm *kind of* excited... I remember liking The X-Files up until Mulder stopped appearing on the show... I don't remember the first movie, though. o_O",0

"1.Cannibal Holocaust The film was banned in countless countries, and Deodato actually had to show evidence, in court, that the film was indeed fake, even going so far as to bring the actors on a popular TV talk show in Italy to prove they were still alive.  2. Men Behind the Sun To be honest, this film could be 100% fictional and it still would have made the top 10 list, as some of the scenes are downright brutal and extremely controversial: a (supposedly real) live cat is thrown into a room of starving rats and torn to pieces; a (supposedly real) corpse of a boy is slowly autopsied; a man is placed in a pressure chamber until his intestines blow out of his anus; a woman is tied to a post outside in the freezing cold, with buckets of cold water being dumped over her head to test the effects of frostbite, then her hands are plunged into boiling hot water, the skin peeling right off the bones; etc etc  3.Guinea Pig: Flower of Flesh and Blood The film itself is fairly simple: a creepy Japanese dude in a samurai suit (donât ask us) kidnaps a girl, drugs her, ties her to a bed, and slowly cuts her to pieces. Thatâs it, thatâs the whole movie. But the special effects are SO well done and so convincing, it really takes it to a whole other level. Fingers, hands, you name it; everything is cut off in slow, agonizing detail. The blood looks great, the gore is splendid, and the dismemberments are top notch (for example, after cutting off one of her hands, the fingers suddenly clench around his wrist, despite the fact it is no longer attached. Yikes.). 4. Cutting Moments Cutting Moments is a disquieting, harrowing look at the mental breakdown and subsequent downward spiral of a family torn apart by abuse, both physical and mental, and the limits of the human psyche. A mostly silent and slow-paced film, thereâs no denying the talent behind Cutting Moments, as Buck masterfully lets silence speak louder then words; allowing the tension of the film to slowly rise to a boil before the incredibly disturbing and permanently scarring bloody climax.  5. Aftermath Aftermath pushes the boundaries of the genre in ways few films even dream of. Nacho Cerda made the film as part of a trilogy, focusing on death, post-death, and rebirth. Aftermath (the 2nd film in the trilogy) shows how we are all at the mercy of others once we die; our bodies nothing more then husks of meat to be poked, prodded, and disassembled.

"The original ""The Wicker Man""   THE 1973 ORIGINAL VERSION NOT the Remake.     I didn't see the remake but Im going to assume this was the ending:  Nicholas Cage jumps out of the wicker man at the last moment that its burning, performs Krag Maga on the village leader and several of the other pagans, disarming his gun taking it and grabbing the girl, Nick C. then gets into a car for a long car chase sequence with villagers in pursuit in their cars, with a hail of bullets following him, he crashes through a random fruit stand. Drives under a semi-truck, turning the car into a convertable, the cars following him crash into it. Then he slams into a firetruck which explodes. It seems like all is lost as the pagans surround a bruised and tattered and burned Nick Cage trapped in his car. Then the sound of helicopter blades:  Miraculously the ATF shows up in helicopters. ATF paratroupers leap out on rope ladders. The ATF burns the entire town to the ground like Waco. At the end of the movie a battlescarred Nickolas Cage, exhausted out of breath, gets praised by the leading ATF Commander (who is also Nick's dad) something like ""Good job son, sorry I doubted you in Waco""   Then the credits roll, and some lame rap music plays with these lyrics: ""Wicka, wicka, wicka; my n$gga, n$gga, n$gga""",0

A few films with very memorable and some moving endings are:  The Shawshank Redemption Ghost ET Blade Runner Casablanca It's a wonderful life Citizen Kane,0
"fight club...buildings exploding to lose my mind, loved it  momento...left my jaw on the floor!  usual suspects....same side effect jaw still located on floor",0
 The only thing good about the ending to Citizen Kane is that it ended: boring. The credits are the highlight of the film.,0
"  Oh right, was that why it became the most acclaimed film of all time? Actually Citizen Kane is a brilliant film, it was highly influential, it was a landmark in filmmaking, it practically changed the way films are made, Orson Welles created a certain cinematography in the film that is revolutionary",0

"Hm...I don't really pay attention to which endings I like best, but I must say I like the ending to the movie Wanted. I saw it yesterday. Actually, the whole movie was pretty good.

"I'm tired of hearing people saying I should vote, but refusing to give me a good answer as to why its so important.

  You don't have to vote.,0
it seems that you made up your mind not to vote...so why bother?,0
Write in someone or pick a third party candidate if you hate the 2 parties candidate.,0
does anyone think that the election process should be changed from electoral to popular vote?,0
"  That was my suggesion too. If everyone would grow some nuts and vote for who they like best, as opposed to the lesser of 2 evils, things might change. People are afraid to ""waste their vote"", which keeps the Democrats/Republicans in power. IMO, a vote for either major party at this point is a wasted vote, at least in the Presidential race. Of course, there isn't much for 3rd chouces either, but at least it sends a message.",0
  yep,0
"Local and State elections, (and propositions?) Yes...please vote.  On a national level? What difference does it make?",0
"you should vote because it is a right given to you...you either exercise it or you lose it. not voting doesn't change a thing or make any sort of statement or give you more of a right to criticize, no matter what george carlin said, god rest his soul. and voting for a third party or a rebel or a renegade isn't a wasted vote either as most party pollywannacrackers would like you to believe. it's just their way of ensuring that two and only two (arguably one) parties stay in power and to squash that the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and even seven parties that a nation this age and of such diversity should have by now.",0
 definately.,0
"I don't vote, gave it up for lent. I feel it is the biggest scam going on.",0
McCain is relying on lazy voters,0
"To your question I will just say that the one year that I did not vote Bush won, and in him winning oil prices soared, healthcare, insurance, food prices soared as well. Secondly, It is best that I try to get people in office who will best represent me and the choices I make in life in addition to the lifestyle I choose to keep. I also have a huge fear that if we choose to not be the deciding factors in the candidacy for presidency, then someone else will. Would you feel safe giving that responsibility to any one group in America? Please make your vote count. Consider the most important things in life to you and vote for the person who will most likely help you keep those things close to home. K",0

(e.g. Bush) #3.ÃÂ  If you think every candidate sucks ass and none of them are worthy of your vote you get more respect from me than if you vote for the person that sucks the least [out of the top 2 parties because you think a 3rd party vote is a wasted vote]. #4.ÃÂ  They're taking your money, they're running your lives.ÃÂ  You ALWAYS have the right to complain.",0
 why?...plain and simple....IT GIVES YOU BITCHING RIGHTS!!!!!! If you don't participate shut up....you don't vote you don't count and actually dont deserve any sayso on the matters.....I've seen people in wheelchairs truck a mile to vote...and you don't....that is sad.,0

I'm not up for lesser of two evils garbage, either.ÃÂ  16 years of crap for candidates ought to have taught everyone that a vote for a shitty candidate is...validation of a shitty candidate.

" if anyone just can walk up and just vote...how are you gonna know if these people actually are citizens of this country?...dont you think it'd be a little chaotic?....btw..driving is not a ""right""...its a privilege...you earn it.",0
"  The problem with using popular voting as a definitive method of making decisions about representatives. . .is that the popular vote is VERY easy to f*ck with. Given the motivation, it's really simple for someone to submit dozens of ballots using a falsified identity with each one. Since it's effectively illegal to make people provide identification when voting(and I agree with this, btw), it's makes for very skewed elections. Of course, that might not happen every time. . .but why take the risk?  I'm not saying that I agree with the Electoral College, either, since it has its own flaws. A new system should be created that does a better job at giving people a say in their government, and in the selection of representatives.",0
It really makes no difference if you do or don't.,0
we have had Presidential elections decided by a hundred thousand votes..two tenths of a percentage point....and 70 million people voted...literally a small town.,0
"I completely agree! It's not something I hear many people complain about though. Considering electors are theoretically free to vote for the candidate of their choice, which means our vote might not count at all.",0
I just registered as a Libertarian! FTW!,0
"Dont vote,cant bitch!",0
By all means if you don't feel like voting don't do it. I believe a big part of the reason this countries gone to shit is because uninformed people with little interest in politics vote because they feel they have a patriotic duty to do so.,0
"   i agree completly,but likewise they best keep theyr mouth shut when something comes along they dont agree with. because you know why,they didnt vote and keep up with the times.",0
" know how you feel... i had a bumper sticker for awhile that said, ""don't blame me, i didn't vote"" things that might make me go vote 1. someone runs that i really think represents me 2. ""none of the above"" actually is counted and has an effect on the election 3. getting rid of the (for presidential elections) the electoral college might get me to register at least 4. noam chomsky running with jello biafra has a chance of me voting 5. some system of accountability put into place so those elected actually have to at least attempt to keep the promises they make during campaigning (maybe if popularity drops below 50% they get booted?)",0
People that always vote Democrat or Republican are part of the problem. The people that don't vote have enough sense to know all of their choices suck.,0
Vote for Ralph Nader with me so we can be part of the 1% that does not jump on bandwagons!,0
" He's got his own bandwagon going. The ""Protest Vote"" bandwagon.",0
"  i have voted and i have failed to vote in the past and i can see why people are getting discouraged about voting. most of the time the candidates you vote in simply disregard what the people want. they often seem more interested in servicing special interests, people who are funded by power groups.  and if you live in a state like texas and you want to vote dem in a presidential election, you can pretty well be assured your vote is meaningless. the same is true if you want to vote gop in new york. so i am for moving toward a popular vote system.  if an i.d. is required to vote, so what? that seems like a reasonable requirement, to prove who you are and that you are only voting once.",0
  this is not true. more people are voting now than ever before! particuly young audiences.,0
"  Here's the one and only reason I can think of to vote. How would you like it if you had NO SAY WHATSOEVER in who you think should be President? What if someone said ""This is what you get like it or not, your opinion doesn't count"". I know come election day the person I vote for won't win BUT I can go to the voting booth and say... ""This is who I think should be President."" A lot of people in this world don't even get that.",0
"unfortunatly everything that is adapted into a movie has alot missing theres threads on x-men,hulk etc. what i will give bay credit for is that he kept the movie with a real sense of aww, watching them transform was very incredible even though they were different very aesthetically pleasing and fun..it was a fun movie to watch and i enjoyed",0
"I do like Bay's style when it comes to action. The transformation scenes made me a little dizzy, they were too close up at times. But he does have a knack for action.",0
"I forgot to add, that I hope they fix all these problems in part 2.",0
I hate EVERYTHING about that fucking movie.  It ruined Transformers for me.,0
"I was never a Transformers fan, and I still hated the movie.",0
"the cgi action in the movie rocked me. michael bay will always suck but thats what people are into. damn, optimus was really gay for humans. he was ""ill die for you guys!"".",0
"I'm sure the next movie will expand on Starscream's personality.  If not, too bad.",0
I still think that Michael Bay focused on the humans more than the Transformers.  It was almost as if the robots were just thrown in as eye candy.,0
i liked the transformers movie..loved it in fact and i literally grew up on the transformers. i thought it told a good story and the action was tight my only complaint is the transformations looked too complicated..there was too many parts n shit movin for me..i think if they had kept the transforming a little closer to the cartoon it would have been perfect..another complaint i have is megatron n starscream was fuckin ugly..they could have made starscream look a little like he did in the cartoon at least and megatron was just plain ass ugly if he comes back in part 2 or 3 maybe they will have him actually scan a jet or somethin to turn into like the rest of em did,0
ALL HAIL TO THE MIGHTY STARSCREAM!!!!!! LOL,0
What he said.,0
The problem with Transformers:  It's a movie about a toy. Michael Bay directed it. Jerry Bruckheimer produced it. Shia Laboeuf was in it.,0
The problem with Transformers is it has 2 many special effects,0
"   Exactly, look at all the CRAPPY movies made from DC characters. I'm hating this JLA movie already and it's not even out yet.",0
"   and that's EXACTLY what ruined all the past Transformer franchieses. Too much focus on humans, especially annoying little kids.  In Generation 1 the balance was perfect. A lot of fans my age say that the saturation of too many new Transformers ruined Generation 1 and made it get cancelled. I don't think so. I think it was the saturation of Daniel being used too much, too many times when the parents were the focus of attention, then they did what Star Trek and Return Of The Jedi made mistakes with, they brought in too many different alien species, which has the same effect as too many humans. The attention was taken away from the Transformers.",0
I'm not excited for number 2. The 1st was so disappointing.,0
"   Well Mr. Allen, I can't really disagree with you. I'm a TF Fanboy myself. I think I feel a bit of excitement, but that could be anxiety and worry over how bad it might be ruined even more. Instead of a magical cube that they all sprouted up from, they might create some other magical ooze that the cube sprang from without any answers to any questions.",0
I just read that have told Megan Fox to Gain 10 Pounds for Transformers Sequel.,0
"where at? Boobs, behind?",0
Good question...  ,0
"What really ruined The Transformers movie is the fact that Michael Bay is not a fan of the transformers, and he stated he did'nt want to make a cartoon of the Transformers, The Transformations were to complex, the transformations of the Transformers from past shows were never complex, they were promoting stuff that took away space for putting more information in the script ( Like Mountain Dew, X-Box, ect. ), They had one of the Original voice actors ( Optimus Prime ( AKA Petter Cullen ), and not the other ( Frank Welker ( AKA Megatron ), Way tomany quotes slaming the original series, Not having Bumblebee a VW bug, and yet having a VW bug in the movie!, none of the desgins looked anything near the original desgins of the Transformers, Not having the Matrix Of Leadership, and instead we get some stupid cube ( Hey was'nt the cube in one of the later Transformers shows ), Bay and Hasbro TRANSFORMED this movie in to a pile of crap! ( Anyone feel free to add the transfomation sound effect! ), the whole witwikey background story, and the selling of his gradfathers glasses could have been deleted, and something better put in, I only payed $2.00 to see Transformers, and to be frank it's not even worth $2.00, that would be an insult to the movies that deserve the admition price of $2.00 LOL!",0
I wanted Frank Welker in that movie.  What in the FUCK were they thinking?,0
Have you played the game or watched how it looks when you hear franks voice with megatron footage?  It doesn't work.,0
  And told her to come over to my house.,0
  Yes  I like it better for some reason.,0
   I thought Frank Welker passed away,0
  Of course not,0
    I stand corrected....I should nominate myself a bitch ass nigga in that other thread.,0
It's understandable that you would think that... he's not as active as he used to be.,0
  I wouldn't say that. Since 2000 he has worked on almost 140 projects. That's almost 18 projects a year.,0
  But most people don't realize that he's in the show or movie that they are watching.,0
I also just realized that he played the Cave of Wonders in Aladdin,0
  But that's the life of a voice actor.,0
"  then you're an idiot for allowing a michael bay movie have an effect on your opinion at all.  and on a broader note, why the fuck can't you people let sleeping dogs lie? haven't you figured out that virtually every dead franchise (star wars, indiana jones, rambo, etc) will just tank when they rehash it?",0
  I was only exaggerating.,0
i had no problem with transformers.. i actually LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie.. i thought it was a well done movie.. and the funny thing is i had never heard of transformers until i saw the previews and the movie looks amazing.. so i saw it ther first day and it was amazing.. shia leboufe is hot im sure i spelled his last name wrong but still what a hottie.,0
"Ugh, horrible to watch.",0
If that had been beer we wouldn't have ever seen this video.,0
"It made my day watching him get it   By the way, all US Military that go through flight training and S.E.R.E. Training go through the same thing. Anyone that swims or surfs alot can easily beat this",0
"PS they are doing it wrong, must be amatures you are suposed to raise the feet up at a 30% angle so there is no possiblity of getting water in your lungs the way these guys are doing it isnt the way our military does it",0
"Let's briefly recap waterboarding in the US for some of the more senile, shellshocked, and/or generally stupid Americans who support this torture:  -As far back as the Spanish-American War, American servicemen were court-martialed for waterboarding suspected insurgents in the Philippines.  -Japanese troops and the Nazi Gestapo used this torture. Japanese were later convicted of war crimes due to their use of the practice on American POWs.  -During the Vietnam war, US Generals declared the practice illegal and several court martials occurred due to the revelation that the practice was being carried out by US and South Vietnamese troops.   The Imperial Japanese, the Fascist Nazis, the Pinochet regime, the Khmer Rouge, etc have all used waterboarding. And now the US does. Nice company we keep, don't you think?",0
 they go through it to be able to withstand it and recognize it so that if they are captured they won't succumb to the TORTURE that it IS.,0
" Another reason they go through it is to weed out weaklings. Steal-your assertion that ""anyone who swims or surfs alot can easily beat this"" is completely ridiculous. Do you really think this is where the interrogation stops if no information is obtained? They go straight from waterboarding to beatings and electric shocks. The difference with this video, and the training of our military personnel, is that the training eventually stops. The torture to extract information does not.  I'd really like to see any of the dumbasses in here who support this go through it just once. They'd admit to having sex with their own mother or father to make it stop. ESPECIALLY if they didn't know what was coming next. Could be freedom, could be jumper cables attached to their testicles. They'd say anything to get the first, and they'd say anything to prevent the second. That's why torture has been proven time and time again to not get the real information you need. Gaining a prisoner's trust and extracting information through more subversive measures is far more likely to get the desired results.",0
What a pussy... you want torture... live with my wife for a week... You'd confess to anything.,0
  They are doing it wrong. It is clear he gets water in his lungs in this demonstration.,0
It was such horrible torture that he went back for more.,0
This how it is done.  http://www.foxnews.com/video2/player.html?110606/110606_greta_ha rrigan&On_the_Record&Harrigan%20Reporting&acc&On%20the%20Record&-1&Sho ws&219&&&new,0

"This isn't even debatable anymore. The ARMED FORCES JOURNAL (the bunch of pansy, pacifist liberals that they are) argued that waterboarding = torture some time ago.  http://www.armedforcesjournal.com/2007/12/3230108  TO RUDY GIULIANI AND ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE MICHAEL MUKASEY For their tacit support of waterboarding. In an interview, Giuliani was asked for his views on using Ã¢â¬Åenhanced interrogation techniques,Ã¢â¬ including waterboarding. He responded that in a hypothetical scenario that assumed an attack, Ã¢â¬ÅI would tell the people who had to do the interrogation to use every method they can think of.Ã¢â¬ Prompted again on the specific use of waterboarding, he repeated Ã¢â¬Åevery method they could think of.Ã¢â¬ Mukasey said he found waterboarding to be Ã¢â¬Årepugnant,Ã¢â¬ but he wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t answer whether it amounted to torture.  Let AFJ be crystal clear on a subject where these men are opaque: Waterboarding is a torture technique that has its history rooted in the Spanish Inquisition. In 1947, the U.S. prosecuted a Japanese military officer for carrying out a form of waterboarding on a U.S. civilian during World War II.  Waterboarding inflicts on its victims the terror of imminent death. And as with all torture techniques, it is, therefore, an inherently flawed method for gaining reliable information.

Why did it look painless? he said the CIA says about 30 seconds is average for the arabs being subjected to it. We need to see a waterboarding video of the real thing.

Gas prices in Ontario dropped from 1.38/l to 1.274/l over the last month. They are now back up to about 1.345/l. That works out to about U.S. $6.00/gal.,0
"Of course, gas prices goes down when I can't drive my car...damned broken foot.",0
" Happy Califrnia your gas have been to high already in Kentucky they,ve gone up 20 cents in past 2 weeks but we are still only at $4.04 a gallon.",0
"  Maybe everything is just evening out, then. A few weeks ago I paid $4.79 a gallon at the gas station by my house and yesterday I paid $4.53 a gallon at the same place. And I noticed at some places downtown it was even ten cents cheaper.",0
"Who knows, but I do find more and more people standing at the gas pump curseing with me as they fill their vehicles.",0
"world demand for expensive gasoline has decreased  if demand reamains low, prices will drop",0
"Thanks for that nugget of brilliance Dujac. To expound and make a predictive statement on that, Chinese subsidies and such are due to drop significantly after the Olympics. So, you should probably see a quick jump up in oil during the Olympics, and then a drop that will continue as world demand stays low.",0
"I know why. There's a presidential election coming up. Bush lifts the off shore drilling ban and prices fall a bit. Makes republicans look good. The oil companies need another Republican president so they can continue raping your wallets. Don't fall for it. And don't worry, gas prices haven't topped off. Not by a long shot.",0
" If you think the oil companies are seeking a Republican President in the house this next election you are absolutely correct. If a Democrat happens to step in to the roll of President the price of fuel will increase. A Democratic President will raise taxes on fuel, making prices sky rocket.  You think prices are hitting you bank account hard now, just wait and see what will happen if a Democrat takes over as commander and chief. You think filling your car now is expensive, just watch and see.. You may be shocked at the outcome.",0
"Gas prices did go down. Or better said, the gas guzzlers went down south... of the border.   The US and Mexican press had a field day sensationalizing the events for several months, which in turn greatly affected tourism and Bajaâs economy as over 40 percent of the Baja coastal region depends on tourism. Baja has experienced the economic pain that also punctuates for them the great binational economic interdependence.  Now it seems that despite the media fervor in reporting and sensationalizing Mexicoâs problems with drug capos, Americans are flocking back to Baja. Why?  Saving money, trumps fear. Gasoline prices now over $4.50 a gallon in San Diego is available anywhere in Baja for around $2.55 a gallon. And the stampede of US trucks buying diesel fuel at $2.20 a gallon versus over $5 a gallon in San Diego, has caught Baja shorthanded an unable to keep up with the demand. Once again the economic interdependence is evident.  Robert Kline from Orange County waiting to fuel up his Ford pickup said that once he began reading and seen on nightly news about all the cars crossing for gas, he figured things canât be that bad, so he decided to come back to Baja that was his favorite weekend retreat. Like Kline, others are beginning to see that things are OK, and they too will begin to travel to Baja. So things will go back to normal during the summer months.  http://hispanicvista.com/HVC/Columnist/posiojr/070608Patrick_Osi o.htm  BTW Mexico's gas prices go up only by inflation rate, where here in the US they are set by the individual sellers (companies).",0
  it's called the 'law of supply and demand'  something that few seem to acknowledge,0
   Try your left foot.,0
"yeah it is a fluctuation but the fluctuations will probably result in the gas going down... I am not kidding you, they might be drilling right now and we need people to drill.",0
  whoa that is expensive,0
  yeah the had pretty much topped off in my own opinion... I don't see it going any higher so that is good news.,0

"  So very true. The language they use is pretty much foreign to probably about 90% of us. Therefore making us equal in the eyes of the law pretty much a out and out lie. Of course ignorance is no excuse, as they say. What gets me is your considered ignorant if your unable to lawyerspeak or speak the tongue of deception.  I've had recent dealings needing a lawyer, That son o bitch ripped me off more than the people I was after. He's 3g's richer and I'm in the exact same situation I was in before he was retained.  I should have handled it the old Irish way, but on the advice of those closest to me, I refrained.  Heh, Maybe I will send that thiefing som bitch a piece of rope and one of those witty Irish quotes and let him think about that not everyone he screw's is going to let it slide, or maybe one day he will turn around and there I'll be, to explain to him about honesty and integrity and when someone charges $300.00 bucks an hour, he damn well better earn it.",0
"Lawyers are the biggest scumbags to live on this planet, all they care about is there F---ing money They dont care if you go to prison. Why do yuu think most of the people in prison are poor, most of them should be in there but it makes you wonder how many innocent people are there just because the scumbag piece of crap didnt get enuogh money to line his pocket! Then the lump of bile when theyve thoroughly screwed there fellow americans out of everything they have, They somehow think that they are now worthy of representing us as Senetor or Congressman. We dont really even get a choice because chances are both sides of the race are going to be scumbag bile. So thats why we end up with a Congress that has the the worst approvel rating in american history.

But they do know how to spend tax money that doesnt belong to them did I mention I hate Lawyers!!!!",0

ÃÂ Yes, there are those who are new and doing it for the experience, and there are those who are doing it because they have to and really donÃ¢â¬â¢t care because they are getting far less for representing someone under the Public Defenders arrangement that they would from a paying customer.ÃÂ  But there are also those who are doing it because they have a desire to see that everyone is defended. ÃÂ  I was on a murder jury where the defendant was defended by the Public Defenders office.ÃÂ  These guys threw their hearts and souls into the defense.ÃÂ  Too bad the guy was guilty as hell, but they mounted several appeals after the conviction, interviewed every member of the jury that would talk to them, and I understand that they are still trying to get this dude out.ÃÂ  I contrast that to a lawyer I had, gave him a large retainer, and he withdrew from the case after he had spent it all, much more, and I asked him to put me on a payment plan.",0
"Lawyers just plain make too damn much money for really screwing you in the ass with a big legal sized dildo. And no, they don't use any Astroglide, either,LMAO!",0
"It's the system that is at fault here. Even if they come forward, there's a good chance it wouldn't have made a difference. Having said that, however, had it been me, I would have went to the judge and DA and told what I know and given up the license. At least, maybe, the verdict could have been overturned. Only maybe, but worth a shot. Even if they didn't give up their client, just said that someone else confessed to the crime. What I don't get is why they didn't do it after their client got convicted. He was done for anyway.",0
" A lot of lawyers LACK ""moral integrity"" which it sounds like you have! Thats why the innocent end up in jail or receive the death death sentence for crimes they didn't commit.",0
"  Well in that case we could just cut one down......even when we need one there still hated. when you think of a lawyer the first thing that always comes to mind is your going to get screwed.  Funny that your bro is a real estate attorney. In my one post about getting screwed over by the one I retained, dealed exclusivly with real estate law. The deception he used to justify his costs was unbelievable, using most of the retainer in phone calls to me ""reviewing the facts"" over and over again. That scumbag even billed me for creating a bill. By the time he actually contacted the developer most of the retainer was gone and of course he needed more money to continue.  There's some things that most decent people don't do, however seems normal for lawyers to cross that line. There in the same class as a funeral director, acting like they feel for your pain and loss, then turn around and sell you a 1,000 casket for 10 grand, of course at the same time selling you a bill of goods that how your departed would be better respected in the silk lined box with the gold plated hardware.",0
" But its okay for an indigent client to get convicted, and who ends up spending a LONG time in jail, or who gets a death sentence when they cannot prove their innocence?

I personally only go to the theater to see movies thatÂ I think are going to be goodÂ  . . all the rest I can wait for DVD.

  This was a present from GodÃÂ !,0
"Bale's Batman voice was shit. (and that concludes the list of things not awesome about ""The Dark Knight"")  The movie is badass. Best (non indie) of the Year. (mainstream NEVER tops indie)  And now, Corrections to dumb comments made earlier by people who just didn't know any better:  1) ""The Dark Knight"" is a gift from god... Specifically to me. 2) Ledger's ""Joker"" is in fact the greatest portrayl of a (super)villain of all times. Primarily due to the fact that He played it in such a realistic way. If a super villain like ""The Joker"" did really exist, I imagine that he'd be exactly like that. Most super villains in movies don't have the level of realistic character depth, that Ledger, (along with the amazing writers) brought to the ""joker"".ÃÂ  Besides... I dare the OP to suggest who IS the greatest villain then, since ""the joker isn't"" 3)I agree that other films have been storywise on par (and better) than The Dark Knight... But what makes this one stand out is that it was done on a mainstream scale.ÃÂ  This movie is VERY noir, and dark, unhappy movies are generally not so big with the mass public.ÃÂ  Thats why we've rarely seen it done (if ever), in a guaranteed blockbuster hit like a Batman movie (or any other big name superhero movie)ÃÂ  I think with the success of ""The Dark Knight"" big budget studios may stop ""playing it safe"" and start producing more films that think outside ""hollywood box"".  -Dark Knight was awesome.ÃÂ  Very Awesome.",0

The f***ing Batmobile was stopped by a stupid rocket launcher! WTF?? ha ha ha!  It was a kids movie written to appeal to the emo generation... I guess that explains all the ""boo hoos"" and ""I'll kill myself if Heath don't get an oscar!""  Some of you REALLY need to get outside more ;)",0
all your bitching and moaning about batman is the same.,0
i had no idea you felt that way.,0

"Just finished watching it. Ok, I was wrong, Last House on the Left does not feature the most vile rape scene ever put on film. Whoa. But hey, at least the victim is not stabbed to death then disemboweled or forced to pee on herself. The I Spit rapists are real humanitarians. The movie itself was not as bad as I remembered it. In fact, while I guess it's really impossible to say you liked or enjoyed a film like this, I must say this is a decent film. The acting was good, and the story was ok. The DVD edition I rented cleaned up the picture beautifully. There's no way I saw a version as pristine as this when I saw it at the drive-in or on vhs 20+ years ago. All the dvd extras were great. Original reviews were available including two I remember very well, from Siskel(RIP) and my man Ebert, that caused it to be removed from the old United Theater here in Chicago. The director of the film gives an interesting commentary and tells about an actual event in his own life that he says inspired him to tell the story. I'd actually have to go against the guys and give this film a marginal thumbs up. The dvd as a package is very good and kudos to the director for not doing a musical score.",0

Ouch that scene was gruesome....This film is technically a lesson to men...  Lesson being Don't fuck with a woman otherwise, she'll cut your balls off in the bath :)",0
never seen it but im renting it tommorrow becuase of this thread thank u :),0

nice i have a dvd planet by my house and they have a bunch of these old cult type horror joints im see if i can find it there...cuz im not sure my video store will have this one...,0

Juss download and burn to dvd :)",0
They showed this in drive-ins? Damn america sure has changed in 20 years.,0
I was 11 or 12 when I first and last saw this.  I think it was the first full frontal I'd ever seen. I vaguely remember gettin a chubby.,0
  I suppose that would be true if you're a rapist. Us norms already know women are nuts.,0
a chubby hahhahahah,0
That movie had a million plot holes. Like they guy who gets killed in the bath tub. Why did he not freak out when he saw that girl again? Did he really think she wanted to hook up after what he done to her?,0
"  Did you watch the whole film? It's obvious why he went back with her. He's an idiot rapist! Many rapists actually believe their victims want to be raped. He felt she liked it and was coming back for seconds, or would that be fourths or fifths? She convinced him when she shot at him one minute, then relinquished the gun. Like I said, he's a freakin' idiot. Who the fuck would even do that to another person in the first place?  This was the uncut version I believe, and I got it from Netflix.  Glad I could entertain you Heidi, I'm a regular Roger Ebert! lol  But seriously, where are all the black movie reviewers? Roger is an honorary brother, but I think I'm going to send in an application.",0
  Are there any drive-ins left in America?,0
"There is one in NJ that I know of and I think there is still one in PA and CA. Not sure about anywhere else. I love drive ins? Loved this movie, revenge is a bitch. I saw it years ago and this was the first film I saw where a woman just fucked her attackers up. Loved that!!! Glad you watched it again. I told you :)",0
"You were correct miss lady! As I reflect back on it, I did find it somewhat disturbing that she allowed the mentally challenged dude to have sex with her before killing him. Did she feel sorry for him and did not want him to die a virgin? I get getting naked with the lead dude to castrate him in the tub, but the hanging thing didn't really make sense. I thought she did it to make it look like a suicide at first, but nope.",0
  We have on in Sac thats been open 20+ years. Its closing after summer :(,0
  Werent all the killings done in a sexual way? I think thats what makes the movie more unique and twisted.,0
"Another one bites the dust huh. Too bad. Going to the drive in as a kid was such fun. Glad to hear there is still one in NJ. And the last two murders weren't sexual really. She didn't have to get naked at all! And I am torn, should I have been happy or sad that she didn;t get naked.",0
  Yeah I didnt see the last murders. I know they were done on a boat but I didnt see how she did them.,0
"Didn't I read somewhere that they are currently remaking this film?  We had the Star-Lite Drive In for many years here but back in the late 1980s it was shut down and converted to a swap meet, which is still is to this day. The giant movie screen is still up and everything though.",0
"Also wanted to add that, while I Spit on your Grave probably does have the most disturbingly graphic rape depictions, does anyone else remember Mother's Day? A bizarre 1980s, direct-to-video(I think) slasher that had the family of backwoods retards who kidnap and rape a group of female campers(the men do while their crazy old mom watches and laughs) and, like I Spit..., features a few of the surviving girls getting revenge on the hicks(one notable scene involved someone downing some Draino) towards the end but the whole thing was disturbing as Hell to me back then. I have not seen it since then though so it maybe just a cheese-fest I do not remember well.  Also Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has a scene or two that put me off of horror flicks for a while.",0
"Yep, drive-ins make great swap meets. The 3 we had in Chicago have all shut down. We do have a movie in the park night(Grant Park) downtown that's free. They show classics like All About Eve, North By Northwest to keep all the crazy teens and gangbangers away. All on a huge screen with great sound. You bring your picnic stuff or just a blanket and chill.  I think I did see that Mother's day. I can't remember what it was about though.",0

What's a Dark Knight? Is this some medieval movie?,0
I saw it. You will not be disappointed. Check out the thread on it on top of this forum. It is pinned at the top for the time being.,0
Actually its what everybody was freaking about in the movie: THE HAPPENING,0
"Originally, I had doubts as to weather or not this film was going to live up to the hype. But, after seeing it this week, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. It was arguably one of the best action flicks I had seen in quite some time.",0

"Great..now Johnnie, Crank, or whatever his names is will come in here and give us the same BS that he gives over and over again. Example- See..everytime someone disagrees with The Dark Knight you guys have to jump all over them beacause they didn't love it! Why don't you ""fan boys"" or ""trolls"" grow up! I see no need to explain myself because at times..I don't even what I'm saying! Blah blah blah, blah blah blah! Oh yeah...YOU TROLLS!",0

Batman saves Harvey.....the girlfriend dies.  Two-face falls to his death in the end.  Joker gets arrested.  The boat with the prisoners on it....they throw the detonator out the window...the other boat doesn't have the courage to push it.  He never shows his true identity....he lets Harvey be a decoy.  The girl chooses Harvey in the note.  The Joker kills the asian guy by burning him on top of a stack of money.,0
Oh...and in the prison...the guy with the stomach ache has a bomb inside of him...,0
if you haven't seen the movie why are you kn the dark knight thread? go see the movie and stop your bitching before i tell you the whole movie,0

"  Actually he has 3 friends in the movie forum! lol  Don't argue with C.Allen, he's just a forum troll that likes to play keyboard ninja and go around the forum cussing people out for attention. Just ignore him and maybe he'll go back to masturbating to his ""cammed"" copy of The dark Knight!",0

"  Just ""Mark As Spam"" or forward to myspace.",0
I think this forum requires a properly maintained special education thread.,0
"I've been talking to someone for about 2 years now on and off. And before we started talking again he got cheated on by his previous gf...so, at first he would never stop talking about her..and I kinda got pissed off...But now, I went on his myspace an dhe has a music video of a song ""missin' you""...and I know sure as hell know it isn't about me. So he tells me now that his ""friend"" posted it up...so should I believe what I saw..or give him the benefit of the doubt?",0
I guess there aren't any Dr.Phil's up in hurr. lmao x],0
"it's definately dedicated to his ex and i'm sure he did posted.it's obvious that he's not ready for a new gf yet,so give him that time cuz all he needs right now is a good friend until he's ready to open his heart to someone else again.  i hope i answered your question...",0

"Well, as others have already said, it was at a bar and it is quite silly to judge an entire nation solely on your experience there. It isn't valid evidence for what you are arguing.  However... I do believe that Americans, whilst not being inherently less intelligent, are, on average, more ignorant than other nationalities about the world around them. Why? Americans grow up without many ""outside"" influences in the media - I would say that 98 percent of your television and film content is American made, american produced, directed, acted..... most of the music that gets commercial airplay in the states are also very much american dominated. Also, geographically, america is quite isolated, really.... sure, britain is an island, but it's only a hop skip and a jump to about 20 different countries...",0
" True, It's not fair to call them stupid, but ignorant would be the right word",0
just because im from London i have never met the queen or the the Spice girls!!!,0
 Well looks like someone won this argument.,0
 Why is it exaggerated? I don't think saying 98 percent of America's film and television content is American...,0

 Lol'd at that  k bye,0
"Now mexico wants to control our laws? Either mexico should keep their people on their side or their leaders should be assassinated! Damn, I hate that country!   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico - Mexico is protesting the execution of one of its citizens in Texas despite a world court ruling for a new hearing, expressing concern for the rights of other Mexicans detained in the United States.  Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said it sent a note of protest to the State Department about Jose Medellin's case, which drew international attention because of allegations that Medellin wasn't allowed to consult the Mexican consulate for legal help following his arrest.  Texas executed Medellin, 33, late Tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in Houston.  Medellin was convicted of participating in the gang rape, beating and strangling of Elizabeth Pena, 16, and Jennifer Ertman, 14. Prosecutors said he and five fellow gang members attacked the girls as they were walking home on a June night, raped and tortured them for an hour, then kicked and stomped them before using a belt and shoelaces to strangle them.  ""I'm sorry my actions caused you pain. I hope this brings you the closure that you seek. Never harbor hate,"" Medellin said to those gathered to watch him die. ""Never harbor hate.""  In Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, where Medellin was born, a small group of his relatives condemned the execution.  ""This is another murder because no one has the right to take someone else's life, only God,"" said Medellin's cousin Reyna Armendariz.  A large black bow and a banner that read ""No to the death penalty ... may God forgive you,"" hung from an iron fence in the front of the house where Medellin lived before moving to the United States at the age of 3.  Armendariz said the family hopes Medellin's body would be return to Mexico.  ""He signed a paper saying he wanted his remains to go to a friend. Who knows if they will bring him here,"" Armendariz said sobbing.  The Mexican government statement said officials ""were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.""  An international court ruled in 2004 that the convictions of Medellin and 50 other Mexicans on death row around the United States violated the Vienna Convention, which calls for people arrested abroad to have access to their home country's consular officials.  Texas state officials say Medellin didn't ask to do so until well after he was convicted of capital murder.  The International Court of Justice, also known as the world court, said the Mexican prisoners should have new court hearings to determine whether the violation affected their cases.  President Bush asked states to review the cases, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this year neither the president nor the international court can force Texas to wait.",0
  I think the precedent is obvious. Don't do capital crime. It's not that hard to understand.,0
"I read that story this morning.... I might, just might, understand if the accused had been here a short time, but this fella came to America when he was 3, has been here 30 years. I'm quite sure, he does not need a Mexican consulate explaining to him our laws.",0
"Yeah, well he is getting some laws explained to him now, ones he should have known all along.",0
"That piece of filth got what he deserved! All these far-lefft loons have gone crazy, they care more about the killer than about the victim. They will never remember the two girls he raped and killed.",0
"I don't know what disgusts me more...  The fact that the bastard raped those two girls, the fact that he hypocritcally preached against hatred (he deserved it for what he did to those poor girls), or the fact that the Mexican government is basically endorsing his crimes.  Hear me illegal aliens, look, if you're so determined why don't you overthrow the assholes in charge of Mexico and make it a better place to live? Or do you condone these heinous actions yourself?  Seriously anyone who defends these bastards should themselves be put in jail. He is just lucky I wasn't there. He meaning both the rapist and the government official.",0
"""nobody has the right to take another...""  He took TWO lives! TWO! And here he is saying that his cousin is worth more than the two girls he strangled and violated?  Sorry the statement of the cousin just pissed me off enough to warrant its own rant.",0
"""Texas executed Medellin, 33, late Tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in Houston.""  ""The Mexican government statement said officials 'were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.' ""  A couple of points: 1) why did it take 15 years to off this pond scum?Â  2) If Mexico is soooooooooooooo concerned about the treatment of their citizens in the USA, why don't they stop encouraging them to come here?",0
  I'd also like to point out that government execution is not a matter of one man deciding to take the life of another man. It is by the LAW that this waste of space was executed.Â  The LAW DOES have the right.,0
"Everyone seems to be missing the point here. By deliberately renouncing the Vienna Convention, U.S. citizens abroad no longer have a right to request consular assistance. The world is fully cognoscente that the word of the United States on an international treaty is now worthless.",0
"  I call Bullshit. Americans are held responsible to the laws of other countries, always have been, always will be. Don't think so? Go spit on the sidewalk in Singapore, see what happens.",0
"Call it bullshit if you want. If said American citizen was arrested for spitting on a Singapore sidewalk before today, the government of Singapore would be required to advise the American consulate in Singapore of the arrest and grant consular access to the arrested party. Yes, the poor slob would probably not avoid a fine and/or jail time but the consulate would be able to ensure that his rights were honoured under Singapore law and assist him in retaining local counsel. As of today, Singapore no longer has to advise the consulate nor permit consular access.",0
"  I belive your statement is based on the FALSE assertion that this scum bag was denied the right to speak to a Mexican Consular. He was in fact NOT denied that right.Â  He and his legal council both neglected to request to speak to the Mexican Consular.Â  If they had requested, they would have been granted their request.Â  It wasn't until AFTER his conviction and AFTER his appeals that they finally decided to mention that he wasn't a US citizen, which is what everyone was previously lead to believe.Â   Neither theÂ prosecution, nor the court had any knowledge of the nation of origin of this douche.Â  Due to the circumstances of his conviction, the world court has NO JURISDICTION over this case.Â  They would like to have, and they might try to say that they have it ... but they don't.Â  Even the US Supreme court reviewed it & agreed that the world court has no jurisdiction.",0
  I absolutely agree with this.,0
" Quite frankly, I don't give a damn about the world court. They can kiss my yankee ass.  Given how tilted our justice system is toward defendants, I'm sure this guy got his fair trial. Bottom line, don't come over and think you're going to get away with murder. Especially in Texas.",0
"  Again, you've missed the point.ÃÂ  The dirtbag was not denied any rights all the way through his original trial & all of his appeals.ÃÂ  The courts gave him every right he asked for, and he was convicted.ÃÂ  It wasn't until AFTER it was too late that he brought up his citizenship.ÃÂ  No treaty was violated.ÃÂ  He and his legal council allowed him to be convicted without contact with the Mexican government.ÃÂ  It's not the fault of the Texas court system that his legal council was incompetant.ÃÂ  It's not the fault of Texas that he chose to rape and murder in a state that EXECUTES murderers.ÃÂ  He was a fool & a murderer & he got what he deserved.",0
" Haha, that made me laugh. I never thought of it, but you're right . . . GOOD!!",0
"   This piece of crap lived longer than one of his victims.  I find it funny (okay, not really) how these humanists who are all for protecting lives (allegedly) find themselves backing someone who took away two lives.  If that does not call for an execution, well, too bad.",0
Mexico can suck eggs.  The scum needed killin.,0
"Thats ridiculous. All I can say is Good Riddens to Jose, I hope Satan treats him real nicely.",0
Do you think Medellin will have any luck trying to jump the border of Hell trying to cross into Heaven?,0
" Hahaha, nah, I'm sure that's one border he can't do jack shit about now.",0
they wasted all that money on a trail and appeals. he was here as an invader therefore we should of shot him as one as soon as we caught him.,0
"  I love this part: ""This is another murder because no one has the right to take someone else's life, only God,"" said Medellin's cousin Reyna Armendariz.  Well Reyna, how about the 16 year old and the 14 year old girls that were brutally raped and murdered? Why didn't your DEAD cousin live by this same philosophy? Thank God the great state of Texas still upholds the law and protects its citizens. If more states would wake the fuck up and put more of these assholes to sleep this kind of shit would slow down to a near halt. Too bad they won't air these executions on pay per view. Then we could give the proceeds to the victims families and some of these fucking animals would see for themselves what rape and murder will get you. DEAD!  My sympathy goes out to the families of these girls. I can't imagine what this did to them.",0
"  Agreed! The only unfortunate part of your comment Mara Jade is the fact that more states should live by the same standards, not just Texas.",0
  Public hangings had a purpose...,0
The world court can perform shrimping on a diseased elephant.,0
"anybody bother by the fact mccain is ""learning to get online"" that is even a few steps down from bushes ""one of the things i've used on the google is to pull up maps""  not that i'm some big obama fan but isn't it time we have a president that is at least mildly computer literate?",0
They got people for that.,0
" well ""they"" have ""people"" for everything...so why even care who gets elected? lets just vote in a retarded paraplegic cat. or to quote Burroughs, ""A$$hole doesn't know what buttons to push or what happens when you push them"" seriously here we have a guy who can pass laws to that effect the internet and doesn't even know how to get on it and i'm willing to bet he can't find the power button on his computer either, but we got people for that. i would just like to think that who ever gets elected is a bit worldly, a renaissance man or woman if you will and so living in our tech driven world understand something about it. its not like i'm asking for the president to be some macrovision drm breaker, just to at LEAST know how to get online.",0
Hahahaha. This thread is funny.,0
"  Indeed they do. You're never seen a puter in the Oval Office.  But you'd have to expect that anyone who is the least bit curious about anything, and wants to see what's really out there besides what is digested by staff, would have a desktop in the private office off the Oval.Â  AlsoÂ a desktop for notes, e-mail, and writing, especially while in transit.  You would expect that with IT so critical to the economy and national security, the Commander-In-Chief would have at least a nodding acquaintance with hacks, viruses, broadband, and such.  He should also know that CERT is not a breath mint.  If there is a generation gap between the majority of the people and Senator McCain, this is another tellingÂ example.  And if this is just a continuation of the incuriosity, inattention, and vincible ignorance of the current president, so much the worse.  ""What color is the red phone?"" -- George W. Bush",0
Another reason why a Rock would make a better president than McLame.,0
"Thats crazy talk Iam sure Mccaine knows how to run basic programs and the internet,You younger people in your twentys that grew up on computers have a hard time beleaving that some people as old as Mccaine probably dont really have a want or need for computers.I know his daughter is the one who runs his election site. I have met alot young of people that dont like PCs and really have a desire to use them. If an executive of a major corperation asks for a document or information, do you really think hes going to sit down at a PC and get it himself? or make one of the people they pay to do it?.",0
  Have you ever been in a CEO's office? Or a VP's office?  Why not visit one soon?,0
" when the information is on a shared drive or within grasp of their computer for them to get? well ever executive i have known has done so. when it is down the hall being typed by his secretary on a royal typewriter, than no, they do usually send for it...or they send an *gasp* and email asking if someone could email them back the documentÂ·which in mccains case he would have to get his wife to come in and help him with",0
"  Wow. A blast from the past. I remember typewriters.  For skool I had a Smith-Corona and then an Olympia portable, plus one of the first Selectrics, ensconced in student publications offices.Â  The skool paper set its type every night on Justowriters, which were almost as noisy as pavement breakers.  In my first job I had a Remington manual, then an Olympia manual with moreÂ enameled sheet steel than a small fridge.  In the next job, everyone had IBM Selectrics.  ThenÂ down the chain to an IBM Executive, with type bars.  The next shop had correcting Selectrics, until the owner bought me a DECmate for Christmas.  Then secretaries became an endangered species.  And middle-aged, highly placed people had to learn how to type.  My heart bled for them.",0
"  Where I work I get a ton of old people that wont use the ""Self Check"" at the damn Grocery because they think its stupid and to hard to learn. When all you do is press a button and the machine tells you what to do next.

I was watching The Faculty the other day..a movie that I've seen MANY times.Yet for the first time I realized it was Directed by Robert Rodriguez...WOW...how dumb did I feel. I love his movies and all this time This was one of his....hahaha.,0
  You probably didn't notice. . . due to the predominantly white cast LOL!,0
   hahaha..that's true...  and after I realized he directed it it finally occurred to me what Salma Hayak was doing in that cast because as of that point it was random that she was in it.,0
hes made two movies that can be considered watchable. the rest of his career he has spent sucking tarantino's cock.,0
   and what movies are those?,0
 I count 3 El Mariachi From Dusk till Dawn The Faculty,0
   what about  Desperado Sin City Planet Terror Spy Kids(hahah j/k),0
  Desperado is the Americanized version of El Mariachi.,0
" Sin City was good but not all him though. Desperado was ok, but the Red Ninja is right it's just american El Mariachi spy kids lol",0
  true..but ehy are good movies....  I do agree with you on the Tarantino bit though.  He needs to pan out by himself!,0
"What do you mean Sin City wasn't all his? I remember seeing an interview withMiller saying that he didn't direct a shot, but was there for advice for a lot of the filming, so Rodriguez insisted that he take a co-director credit. I'm sure he helped make it great, but that movie in and of itself was all Rodriguez. That said, I'd agree to all the movies listed so far as being worth watching. In your post and the other with a list. I'd throw in Once Upon a Time in Mexico, but mainly only for Depp's performance.",0

"Do you think it is just a nasty rumour made up by man haters,or a genuine truth? Do you agree that men have run their course?  Thoughts please,everybody!!!",0
Most boys/men I know seem to think that women are inherently inferior...,0
"I think men and women are mostly equal, but woman usually don't have as much power as men because of three things:   1: Woman are more likely to have less time to gain rank, they spend more time on education, family, etc. and they spend more money, money = time lost.  2: Woman are less likely to use force in order to get what they want.  3: Woman care about other peoples' feelings too much, they are less likely to get rid of people who are in their way.  Basically the percentage of woman who ""play nice"" is higher than the percentage of men who do. Also they focus on education more than men. (the education system actually tends to hold people back in life --- it's hard to prove due to the fact that the corporations think otherwise, without corp./gov. backing it would be obvious though.)",0
"I don't believe that women and men are equal, it is something women are still trying to strive towards this very day.  I don't think it is a matter of time, education or ""playing nice"" but rather lack of experience and setting a higher bar for oneself (demand more). Women need to be more demanding and stand up for what they believe in. There is nothing wrong with having your voice heard or making a man serve you.  In ancient times it was a common thing to have men for slaves, ones that worshipped their goddess. By demanding more from men and holding that power that we truly have but have lost over time (threw greedy white men) it is a matter of regaining and utilizing what we have inside of us.  Being in control doesn't always have to be associated with bdsm or even being a control freak. Control, domination and power can come in many levels. It is a matter of what you want out of your own life and using what you are comfortable with.  All in all, be yourself!",0
"According to most sitcoms that I watch... Yes. We are entering a world dominated by women. Or are as my nerdy half cousin would call it: ""We are about to interface with theÂ orifice of a matriarchtical society, flamen!""",0
all of this shit is funny.,0
"Personally? I think everything is based on personal merit.  I've come up against several men of power in my life who are inherently sexist, but I have never failed to get what I wanted because I never let them regard me in a lower way. I think if you have enough respect for yourself and a general air of confidence, you can get most things done.  This is probably because I grew up training horses with guys though. You can whine, bitch, and moan.  I think women are definitely at a disadvantage because there is a high percentage who rely on being cute to get their way... which can work to an extent, but not in a way which will earn you any kind of respect in the future. More likely a pat on the head and a send her on her way.",0
 soooo how the hell does that put other women at a disadvantage?LOL..don't even answer.,0
"   Haha, I will answer.  Because, if some chick screws her boss to get a raise, how much respect is there in that? She's basically a whore.  That's an extreme example, but generally the meaning is the same. I don't respect girls who use their looks to get what they want in the work place.",0
" Key Phrase:""She's basically a whore.""  ...",0
That's what I'm saying. There's no respect in that relationship. So how can they be equal?,0
This thread just made my morning. :),0
" finally , a sharp minded teen.",0
"Women have made great strides here in the past few decades, thanks in part to the feminist movement. Women have more opportunities available to them now than they've ever had. (At least in recorded history). They are now able compete in more sports than ever before and they now have equal access to colleges and schools and to most careers. And now with equal access women are showing that they can hang and even outshine the boys. More women than men are going to college and more are graduating and starting new careers. On some campuses almost 70% of the student population is female. Women are taking on more leadership responsibilites and some tests show that women in general make better managers or leaders. Women in their twenties in most large cities in the US are actually making more money than the men in their own age group. A lot of successful women are finding it hard to find a man who makes what they make. More and more, women are actually making more than their husband of boyfriend. I do believe society has become more feminized. Just look at the news with the war in Iraq. Ever since Vietnam, people have begun to question war and the need for it. Women historically have never been in favor of war and most men are becomming that way. I believe Women are definately making a huge mark on history at this very moment and I do believe we will see more of a female influence on leadership, politics, education, etc. etc. etc. where before they never had a voice.",0

Usually there's a sign at the check in saying that they have the right to refuse passage to anyone appearing drunk, etc.. But you're always going to get things like this happening.  And what we don't know either is how much the cabin crew took from them for any in flight drinks?

"What was the problem with these women, Alan?",0
 If that were really two men what would they have done do you think?,0
  i doubt that will happen since alot of money is made off of the alcohol sold on board.  the flight attendents should just simply cut off anyone who seems too drunk,0
"  Â  They were drinking alcohol which they bought before they boarded the aeroplane . But why should sales be suspended just because of one incidentÂ ?

I'm probably going to get flamed for this........    Scotland benefits more from Public Spending then the South East. We may benefit from Scottish oil but they benefit from our taxes.,0
"It gets less than Wales or nothern Ireland though.  Interesting map, if i ever go to Britain, i wont be staying in London or the south east :P",0
"  It does point out that England isn't the only one to benefit from the Union. The South East might be the wealthiest part of the country, however it also pays most tax per head and spends less per head in public spending.",0
"   i agree,  as for scottish oil, i doubt that they will be able to nationalise the oil, currently the profits get sent in londons direction but there is a lot of scottish financial interest down here so what is being proposed would essentially receive opposition from scottish business who would be loosing out to scottish politics  nevertheless, i believe the main problem is thatÂ the oil may be up there, but we own the technology to properly extract it  southerners get taxed to the hilt in proportion to what we get for our taxes,  whats happening with the credit crunch now is interesting  big business is coming under scrutony because of its corruption, but what the silent majority dont realise is that greedy london business is the only thing keeping this country going at the moment, if the banks flop then we can fall back on our steel works or engineering, we have a global economy and apart from business, britain has nothing of great significance to offer  its said that we are now a service economy but i think that is just a political buzz term for fucc all, in an age of mass outsourcing of our services, i think its a bit of orwellian double think",0
"  It's quite amazing how rude some people can be.  My first post said ""Discuss"" with the title asking a question, not making a statement.

To answer the question... based on the map posted in the thread it's obvious the southeast is not receiving the same percentage of taxes. I'm guessing that the southeast financially speaking is wealthier than the northern parts. It is fashionable for wealthy people to donate to charities. It is possible that whatever taxes they have less of in comparison with the other parts are compensated for by people donated to various charities such as privately funded soup kitchens and other things of that nature. Now in saying all that I said I was not implying that all public services are necessarily necessary and in writing what was just written previously in this sentence I was not saying whether or not I disagree with various public services being funded.,0
"  My thought is why did you have to say GTFO. Could you not simply talk to me instead of insult me?  Sheltered background? You really know nothing about me, do you?",0

  GTFO is still telling people where to go which is pretty disrespectful.,0
  Are you 12?,0
"To be honest, I can't be bothered having a row with someone I've never met.  If I think telling someone to GTFO is rude then it's hardly a surprise if I find it rude when someone says it to me. I don't care if you don't think it's rude.  I'm gonna leave it at that.",0
"  A bit late in the day but you're right, you will get flayed for this.  This is the argument that Kelvin McKenzie tried to use when doing a bit of Jock bashing on quesiton time.  However, the true figures that came about later showed that out of the UK Scotland was the only part that received what it gave, ie we are self sufficient, if you include the revenues from Scottish gas and oil which at present has been subsidising the rest of the UK since the 70s.  Scotland says it pays its way and does not need English taxes Â· Analysis assigns all North Sea revenues to Edinburgh Â· Spendthrift claims based on 'myths and mistakes'  James Meikle The Guardian, Saturday November 3 2007 Article history Scotland pays its own way despite its depiction as a spendthrift nation abusing the generosity of English taxpayers, according to a new analysis of government spending. And far from receiving an unfair proportion of the tax pot, the breakdown shows that Scotland gets less public spending per head than Northern Ireland or London. Tax revenues from Scotland almost match the country's Â£49.2bn a year public spending - although only if all North Sea oil and gas revenues are attributed to Edinburgh, a controversial allocation.  The research, published yesterday by the Glasgow Herald, is based on Treasury figures in Whitehall, an analysis by consultants Oxford Economics and the newspaper's own calculations.  Tired of the clamour from English politicians and the London-based media for Gordon Brown to rein in the Scottish executive's spending, the paper said much of the ""mischief"" was based on a series of myths, mistakes and misconceptions.  David Cameron has signalled that he would review the Treasury system for sharing government funds across the country, adding that people should not think ""there was some magic pot of gold"" in England. Former Sun editor Kelvin Mackenzie also attacked ""our tartan chums"" for taking the ""clever wealth-creators"" of England for granted.  Critics say that Scots receive Â£1,500 a head more than people living in England, but the new analysis suggests the truth is more complicated. Despite its pockets of deprivation - one-third of the UK's landmass and far-flung communities are in Scotland - the average Â£9,631 public spending per head is less than London's Â£9,748 or Northern Ireland's Â£10,271. While cities such as Glasgow receive high levels of incapacity benefit, the overall welfare bill per head, Â£3,086, is lower in Scotland than in large parts of northern England.  The tax take from Scotland is only outranked by London, illustrating how Scots and their businesses are making their contribution to UK coffers, the report said. Not only did the North Sea bonanza swell Britain's public purse, but the nation's heavy smokers, though banned from smoking in public places before the rest of Britain, swelled the tobacco duty contributions disproportionately, contributing more than Â£1bn a year out of a UK Â£8bn.  Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said: ""This destroys the myth that Scotland is anything other than a resource-rich nation, well capable of flourishing with independence. Of course, the myth of the subsidised Scot has been peddled not just by Westminster Tories and the English tabloids , but also by politicians in Scotland for their own partisan ends.""  The Herald's senior commentator, Alf Young, said the picture was far more nuanced than the black and white certainties of London-based tabloids. ""Scotland is not some subsidy-obsessed outrider of the British state, offering little in return by way of tax revenues. There are other parts of the UK which receive higher per capita allocations of public expenditure.""",0
  I'll refer you to my explanation. taxation has been a bit murky in the UK with whitehall for decades fleecing Scotland whilst perpetrating the myth that Scotland scrounges off the rich south.,0

WOW cuz its so important to know about that.

social heathcare will fail in this country it hasnt worked anywhere else it wont work here.  i belive we need to make healthcare a little cheaper to a certain degree. we shouldnt just give it away like to do food stamps. the more u give stuff away like that the higher prices go up so you still cant get it. its like when he said if u just tax the corps. they just go up on prices what we need to do is not tax anyone more but to stop all the loop holes in the system. you can raise the tax all you want on the rich they will just find a way out of it.  oh and on you stupid comment about 250K being rich yeah like 30 years ago. my Father makes 140k alone that doesnt include all th bonouses he gets through out the year and the investments he has made and yet he is still struggling a little not alot but he odesnt have a maid or personal driver in fact he dives a 1997 dondge intrepid that needs new brakes and belts. yes he does things with my mom time to time but they work thier ass off to save money for trips. we went from being in a trailer trach area to living in a nicer town. its not 90210 but its safer and better then what we had before and its cuz he worked his ass off and still does.

I never had any illusions about him. I thought that at best, he'd have a 10-4 or 12-6 record at 38. Slice has never even had an amateur career and he's going up against guys who've been doing it their entire lives. he was SUPPOSED to be fighting tomato cans. everybody demanded that he fight stiffer competition to justify the personna that Elite XC manufactured or magnified for him. i wasn't a supporter because I bought into that hype. the fight world and entertainment in general has always been plagued by that kind of hypocrisy. good fiction outsells reality in every genre.",0

What surprised me even more was the absence of his don king like promoter. perhaps he dropped him, which id respect yet again",0

Note: 2006 is the most recent data available from the Federal Reserve Board,0
It is also when the subprime mortgage frenzy was beginning to really boom.,0
"I have been reading up on the Community Reinvestment Act, have any of you?  Opposite of subprime  CRA-motivated loans tend to be the opposite of subprime loans, most of which were issued by mortgage brokers and mortgage companies and financed by investment banks, none of which were covered by the CRA.  Here's more evidence that you've been hoodwinked. This information was collected by the Center for Responsible Lending:  â¢ The CRA was effective long before the subprime market existed.  â¢ The CRA has been around for three decades and the financial instruments that allowed the subprime mortgage industry to rise and crash came into existence within the past five years.  â¢ Investment banks, not the federal government, had the appetite for risky loans.  The Wall Street-based market for reselling subprime created the demand for riskier loans. Because the debt would be sold into the market and not kept on the lender's books, many lenders did not bother to verify a borrower's income or assess ability to repay the loan.",0
hey freak you're talking to yourself  no one believes you cuz you lie too much oh wow yu read the cra woo i'm impressed your so smart...worship yourself,0
 So prove his lies wrong.,0
  I thought you were blaming Bush before.. What's going on with that?,0
"  I'm building my case.  So far, you're not denying any of it. LOL",0
"Right.  Say I'm a mortgage lender. Just because I make mortgages doesn't mean I keep them on my books. I make the mortgage and then sell that mortgage to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  Both Fannie and Freddie were buying up a ton of private mortgages. Just because they did not create the initial mortgage doesn't mean that they did not eventually own the mortgage.  Mortgage lenders were being unscrupulous but when you know you can make a shitty mortgage, turn around and sell it to Fannie and Freddie, and still make a profit there is a definite moral hazard.  As I've said before Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac facilitated this problem.",0
Fannie and Freddie held a small percentage of these bad mortgages. You would know that if you read the info provided for you.,0
 Question:  Did you lend to people without down payments by issuing ARMS? Why did you do it? Did their income match up to what they could traditionally afford?,0
"Ok, I read the whole article. The most I saw was that as of 2006 Fannie and Freddie had gone from holding 56% to 24% of subprime loans. Thats a reduction yes, but in portfolio terms that is still a HUGE amount weighted toward a risky asset.  The bundled mortgage securities that fannie and freddie offer were seen as minimal risk investments and the fact that 24% of there holdings were in the subprime market sounds downright ludicrous to me.  However, maybe i missed something in the article saying that they only held a small percentage of these loans. can you point me to it?",0
"  I'm not a mortgage lender but if I was an unethical lender I would write you a zero down ARM with a great teaser rate just to get you into the mortgage because I know I can sell this arm loan off to Fannie and Freddie and I don't have to eat it when you default.  I didn't really care what your income was, is, or could be because my profit is coming when I sell the mortgage off.  Essentially, my risk is minimal because it is assumed by Fannie and Freddie. I make easy profits because I do not have to keep bad mortgages on my books.",0
"  Subprime lending was at its height from 2004 to 2006 (hint: this was where the problem lies) - at the height of this, 84% of these bad loans were not made by Fannie and Freddie. Pretty simple math my man.",0
" Gotcha. I would like to sit down and talk with a lender who has done that. I would like to know their thought process and see if they really thought they were helping low-income families afford a home or if they knew it would all blow up, but hoping they would be off the ship before the family defaulted.",0
Have you not read what I have been writing.  Just because 84% of these bad loans were not made by Fannie or Freddie does not mean that Fannie or Freddie did not come to own these loans.  The problem is NOT where the loan originated but the problem IS where the mortgage ended up. These loans were made in the private sector and then came to be owned by Fannie and Freddie.,0
*above post is to Preston,0
  You need to show that they did in order for me to be concerned... I don't jump to conclusions without evidence.,0
"well from your article  ""Fannie, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., don't lend money, to minorities or anyone else, however. They purchase loans from the private lenders who actually underwrite the loans.""  -like I've been saying.  combine that with:  ""Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent""  -which i earlier explained is a huge amount of risky debt to hold. Especially if you're bundling all these mortgages together and selling them off as bonds. Fannie and Freddie were whats known as GSE's (government sponsored enterprise). A problem with GSE's is that many investors like AIG, Lehman Brothers, China, banks, etc. view debt issued by GSE's as risk free because they think the government wont allow the debt to default. Essentially, GSE debt ended up being viewed as Treasury debt with higher return and the same risk. Turns out that wasn't the case now all this debt issued by GSE's has questionable value and its making everything go to shit.  In the end it looks like your article was written by somebody who doesn't know how this whole system works.",0
  Still waiting....,0
"Obviously, you have no idea how the mortgage markets worked. What benefit would it be for Joe Lender to hold on to a loan he knows will go bad? Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac acting as intermediaries between the lenders and the overall secondary mortgage market facilitated this entire situation.  The article itself says that 24% of Fannie and Freddie's assets were subprime. Percents are ratios. 84% of the total sub prime loans made is not calculated from the same total number that 24% was derived from.  Do you need proof that Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages and sell them on the secondary market?  Here from Fannie Mae's website, ""Fannie Mae operates in the U.S. secondary mortgage market. Rather than making home loans directly with consumers, we work with mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners to help ensure they have funds to lend to home buyers at affordable rates. We fund our mortgage investments primarily by issuing debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets.""  I can't find an actual figure stating how much of these private sector loans were actually sold to Fannie and Freddie. However, citing that Fannie doesn't make direct home loans to consumers they had to buy their sub prime holdings from somewhere. My guess is the private sector since thats where the mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners reside.",0
You've proved nothing. You've made an assumption and jumped to a conclusion without evidence.... and that is all.,0
So you're claiming the secondary mortgage market has nothing to do with this mess?,0
"  Fannie and Freddie went from holding half of all subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding only a quarter of them (see the article I posted).  The reason? They were restricted by laws more than private institutions were.  The private institutions dominated the secondary mortgage market.... so, evidently you're confused.",0
"Yes, I've cited those figures. Think about it. Thats two giant institutions holding 24% of volatile debt, pooling it with other mortgages, and selling it off as safe with a wink that its backed by the U.S. government. Plus, these two companies didn't have the same transparency of information rules that other private companies were held to. That is a giant risk.  Although the remaining 76% is held privately. That 76% is probably split up between more than one or two organizations. That mitigates risk. Furthermore, when these private companies were pooling the mortgages they wouldn't be able imply that their bonds would be backed by the U.S. government.",0
There has been talk now surrounding this game being turned into a motion picture. concidering this is actually a part of the Star Wars saga I wouldn't be surprised if this does become a movie one day down the line. what does everyone else think?,0

"Oh God! No more fucking Star Wars, please..(!)",0
I think it'll never happen.,0
"  I know, seriously! And this is coming from a huge Star Wars fan too. I'm starting to get pretty sick of it.",0
"  Well George Lucas swore that there would NEVER be an Epsiode 7,8 and 9 and concidering that Mark Hamill is old now just leaves out the possibility right there as well. Reason I think The Force Unleashed would work is because the story is right there. The story is actually in between the Episodes and is explained well on what happened to the Jedi and who finished them off.  I beaten the game and do believe that alot of the segments would work well in the movie. The part where the secret apprentice takes down a Star Destroyer with his force powers would deffinitally work well in the film as so would his fights against the Jedi he was tasked to kill. Also the ending sequence would most certainly make the film as well if it does happen.  I still have yet to see The Clone Wars movie and TV show and am awaiting the live action Bounty Hunter series due in 2011 but if there is any TRUE Star Wars film to be made it would have to be The Force Unleashed in my own opinion.",0
" Star Wars should be left alone, unless it's Knights of the Old Republic and has nothing to do with Lucas. I'm sick of Lucas raping stormtroopers and spitting in the face of fans.",0
"  I will admit I would love to see a KOTOR movie but it will not happen until George Lucas sells his rights. I will also go on to admit that Epsidoe 1 n 2 were not so impressive and thankfully Epsiode 3 was THE best in the prequels. The fact Episode 3 took a darker turn was THE best choice for the final installment. Also it isn't George Lycas' fault he cannot direct anymore. Before agreeing to Write/direct Episode 1,2 and 3, George Lucas hasn't directed since Episode 4 which was released in 1977.  After Epsidoe 4 he just produced the Indiana Jones Trilogy and along with Star Wars Episode 5 and 6. It was a shame that Episode 1 n 2 weren't that good but at least they were decent. I still have yet to see The Clone Wars show so there is no telling if George Lucas gotten worse or a tad bit better.  Anyhow I personally think a Force Unleashed film would work if handled right",0
" The prequels being 3 of the worst movies is hardly a secret.The only redeeming quality of the three were Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul, and in typical Lucas fashion he took the only good things in the films and killed them. Hayden Christensen's acting is on par with Keanu Reeves, but considering the ep 1-3 held little continuity to the original 3, I guess his horrible acting falls short of being the top reason things went wrong.",0
  Hayden Christensen was likely THE worst cast for Anakin Sykwalker. I figured either George Lucas either wanted a bargain bin actor or he just couldn't find anyone else to replace him. I remembered after Episode 2 came into theaters it was rumored that Hugh Jackman was to take over the role of Anakin Sykwalker. Reason that was the rumor was because it was said at the time that Episode 3 would take place a big amount of years after Episode 2.  It was right when Episode 3 went into production that everyone around saw that the rumor was false and Hayden was back.I personally liked Episode 3 alot and did appreciate alot of the things in it. I liked the entire beginning with the battle over Coruscant took place which lead to the duel between Anakin and Count Dooku.  I also liked how the emperor held a lightsaber and did combat with Yoda and also the whole battle sequence between General Grievous and Obi Wan was surely entertaining. I liked Episode 3 and it would be entertaining to see The Force Unleashed turned into a film. if it is written well and has a good director on board I would be satisfied.  If The Force Unleashed is turned into a film I would highly doubt George Lucas would direct. He would most likely co write and probably produce. The least Star Wars brand he would direct would be some of the episodes on the upcoming live action TV show due in late 2011.,0
"Ok one Force Unleashed wouldn't work...  Why because Dath Vader is best left where he is and also where the fuck would this new apprentice fit into the whole saga without being mentioned in Episode 4 - 6. Because remember that Force Unleashed is set during the time span of 3 - 4. What happen inbetween that big gap in the saga. Its best left as a game and nothing more. And come on can they really find anyone else to do Darth Vader.   KOTOR has acctually been in discussion and George Lucas apparently expressed interested in the project as a motion picture film in 2 films, after he completed Episode III. But Lucas then decided to cancel and wipe away the idea and revealed that the ideas he had written and expressed down that would have appeared in the two KOTOR movies, will now appear some where in the anticipated Live Action Star Wars Series, which may never come, since its been in pre-production God knows how long",0
"I'm not sure how I would feel about it joining the other films, but the TV spot for the game almost made me run out and buy a PS3 !  I would not mind more SW films at all, but they would have to fit the story line that is already in place.",0
  I thought he raped Indiana Jones?,0
"  Nah Indiana Jones got raped by a stormtrooper, that got raped by Lucas ;)  Who knows whose gonna get raped by Lucas next probably Jar Jar's son",0
"  Well James Earl Jones is still alive and could do the vocal work for Darth Vader. In the past films other people filled in for the suit and James Earl Jones just did the voice over work on the character. I think the story could work for many reasons. One reason is that George Lucas produced and okayed the story for the game so if there is actually a movie he would okay the movie script since he was involved closely with the game.  Also the film could fit in really well into the saga. The reason the secret apprentice wasn't mentioned in Episode 4-6 is because he was a ""secret"" apprentice. Noone was allowd to know of his existence which makes logical sense as well. I think the film could work and possibly go into production in the coming years. The Episodes may be done but doesn't mean there can't be side story films to be made.  As for the TV series. George Lucas and his producer Rick Maccallum said recently that the 2 are sitting down with TV writers to get the much anticipated Star Wars live action show underway. So far what is said about the TV show is it won't have Jedi or even Darth Vader in it and would more or less focus on Bounty Hunters like bobba Fett. I am pretty hyped for the show but it isn't due til 2011",0
 when they came to arrest Lucas at the end of the show they caught him raping a stormtrooper.,0
"After so many broken promises, integration is key.By Alfred Kokh  from the October 15, 2008 edition  Moscow - It's a truism that stable and friendly relations between two countries require each to look at a situation from the other's point of view. The recent tussle between Russia and the West over Georgia is a stark reminder of how the United States has fundamentally never understood Russia's point of view.  The conventional view is that Russia in recent years has been pushing away from the West. But the reverse is more accurate. The Russia-Georgia conflict is a consequence of the West's ""pushing away"" of Russia.  Russia needed a good friend to stand by her side the past 15 years, to counsel her on becoming an open, democratic country tightly bound to the West. Russia thought it had found a friend in America. Unfortunately, despite the desire of Russia's newly formed leadership to move closer to the West, to be integrated to Western institutions, there was no move to meet Russia partway. All issues of integration were talked away during the many years of negotiations, and all questions of economic aid ended up as miserly loans from the World Bank.  Having worked in Boris Yeltsin's government as a deputy prime minister, I know how the West tried to persuade Russia to take on the entire foreign debt of the former USSR. Russia agreed to take this very difficult step in the hope that the West would appreciate its sacrifice and begin seeing the world through its eyes. Unfortunately that did not happen. Yeltsin's government ended up with almost no allies or supporters in Russia. He was perceived as a puppet of the West, his policies dictated by the US. It should come as no surprise, then, that Vladimir Putin came to power as he did in 1999.  Now, the West considers Prime Minister Putin a foe of democracy. But he was the first to support America after 9/11, and he provided substantial help in organizing operations in Afghanistan. Putin made simple requests in return: membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), dropping visa entry requirements to European Union (EU) countries, and significant cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). All this was promised to him and none of it happened.  Let's imagine for a moment that Russia had been integrated into the West. Then the corruption of the Russian judicial system and its susceptibility to administrative pressure would be balanced by European judicial institutions and the imperfections of its electoral system would be muted by European legislation and the European parliament. The government's economic policies would be in accord with the norms of the EU and WTO and Russia's military independence would be constrained by NATO rules. The human rights situation in Russia would be very different.  The West would only win in this scenario. Instead, it has surrounded Russia with missiles and radar stations and accumulated conventional weapons in close proximity to its borders. It would be naive to expect Russia to make concessions such as ratifying the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty under these conditions. Opinion polls show that promoting pro-Western policies in Russia today without an equivalent response from the West would be political suicide for Russian leaders. Neither the military establishment nor citizens would support such concessions.  The situation in Georgia is a global embarrassment, a tale of contradictions. And, the reaction from Russians and Americans is, simply put, ironic. Russian leaders were crying crocodile tears over the genocide of Ossetians, and voicing outrage over the shelling of Tskhinvali. But they had done the very same thing in Chechnya just a few years ago. The American administration is no better, attacking Iraq for bogus reasons, destroying an entire nation, inciting further religious terrorism, and killing tens of thousands of civilians.  To understand Russia's actions in Georgia, the West must first understand that Russia does not see herself as the losing side that must be punished for the cold war. Second, there is a dangerous historic precedent: In 1919, the Entente forced Germany to sign the humiliating Treaty of Versailles. Historians suggest that the repercussions of that Treaty led to World War II. Had the Allies looked at the situation from the German point of view, history may have taken a better course.  Perhaps the conflict in the Caucasus will at least force the West to talk to Russia about real integration â WTO membership, for example. For if Russia continues to be ""pushed away"" â left alone with its anxieties and the anxieties of its leaders â relations will definitely sour. Do not forget how many nuclear warheads Russia has and how many Russians want to save the country's honor.   â¢ Alfred Kokh is the author of the upcoming book, ""A Crate of Vodka: An Insider View On The 20 Years That Shaped Modern Russia.""

"VIVA la RESISISTANCE(but4real this time dude) Body: Is It Time for a Rebellion? October 20, 2008 ""50 percent NO and 50 percent HELL NO!""--Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va. ) on feedback received from his constituents regarding Congress' bailout package Mere days after President Bush signed into law an $810 billion bailout bill aimed at rescuing the Wall Street financiers, one of the recipients, American International Group Inc., threw a $440,000 bash for its executives at a swanky resort, complete with spa treatments, banquets and golf outings. At the same time that AIG execs were celebrating lavishly, indirectly at taxpayer expense, nearly 12 million American taxpayers, who owed more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, were in danger of foreclosure. As if it weren't bad enough that a fiscally irresponsible corporate America is going to be bailed out at taxpayer expense, Congress included more than $100 billion in pork barrel projects in the bill. Nothing short of congressional bribes, these so-called inducements range from an exemption from excise tax for wooden arrows designed for use by children and tax write-offs for motorsports racing track facility owners to tax rebates on rum imported from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as imported wool. This is not relief, it is economic slavery. It has become increasingly clear that the greatest threat to our freedoms--and our bank accounts--does not lurk outside our borders. Rather, it prowls among us, in the form of a government of wolves that is running wild and riding roughshod over our freedoms. There was a time when such a blatant disregard for the burden being laid upon the American taxpayer would have elicited howls of outrage, protest marches and perhaps even outright rebellion. Today, however, many Americans understandably feel helpless to do anything about their plight. After all, despite the fact that calls and emails to congressional offices were overwhelmingly against the $810 billion pork-laden bailout, the legislation passed anyway. Yet consider this: at its core, the quest for the American dream is about gaining sovereignty over one's life and property. Without it, there can be no freedom. While we have become accustomed to equating property with land ownership, the term is much more fundamental and personal. It refers to a kind of sovereignty over one's life and possessions--especially one's money. Questions about who has ultimate control over our money, how much of it can be claimed by government and how it gets spent go to the heart of the battle over property rights. Governments generate no wealth on their own. Any resources that they have at their disposal have been appropriated from the original producers of that wealth, the citizens. This fundamental truth has largely been forgotten over the years. Yet the government's respect for and treatment of the property of its citizens often reflects its attitude regarding its citizens' rights as a whole. Conversely, a government that doesn't respect the rights of its citizens will have even less regard for their property--be it land, money or personhood. With the Wall Street bailout, the President and Congress simply disregarded the clear will of the people. And while secret agreements were obviously made and backroom bargains struck, the Constitution and our rights were not even given a second thought. However, those who wrote the Constitution drafted our founding document with the intention of ensuring that the power of government remained with the people. The Framers wanted citizens to know what the government is doing and how it spends taxpayer funds. And if the elected officials aren't doing their jobs or the people disagreed with their performance, the Framers empowered the people to unseat their representatives. Without these safeguards, there is no representative government. Since the country's inception, America has been synonymous with the concept that there are certain individual rights and freedoms that no one, not even government agents, can violate. As the Declaration of Independence boldly proclaims: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. "" These were revolutionary ideas in an age of kings and serfdoms, and they served as a springboard for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These rights were considered absolute and so precious that no government can violate them. And the early American colonists believed these principles were not only worth fighting for, they were worth dying for. One of these was the right of the people to change or do away with a government that attempts to undermine their rights. As the Declaration concludes, ""whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. "" Governments are brought into being to protect our rights. When they systematically violate them, the people have a right--nay, a duty--to resist. This was the true spirit of 1776 that moved the American colonists to start a revolution against a government that was violating their rights. This willingness to stand and fight against corrupt government was what it meant to be an American in our nation's early years. And if we truly want to be Americans today, it will mean practicing every form of nonviolent resistance available to us as citizens--including picketing, mass protests, sit-ins, boycotts and so on. It will certainly take more than voting for or against a particular politician. Thomas Jefferson was right: ""What country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance?"" Available online at: http://www. rutherford. org/articles_db/commentary. asp?record_id=559 Exactly dude thats what i been tripping on for to long!! we have to take action its getting worse all the time!!! any ideas for putting together a meeting of some sort? maybe finding hella people who see it like that too so we can all change this country back to what we were supposed to stand up for, so we represent and stand for what we were meant to stand up for. how often are elections started with an idea that we, the actual people, has decided? we are brain washed into believing we are making the important decisions when in all actualites THEY,[the ""president""(our king) and his noble mary men(the government end elected political officials] give US preselected canidates to vote on so ""we"" choose witch of the presented options THEY give US. So they this play mind-fuck game where people truely do believe we as the worlds free people are together deciding through this little""what do u wanna do huny? u decide""ol' trick: much like a parent gives a child, you can pick!! a., b., c., or d. its YOUR decision you pick... WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE: not even in fine print, BUT if u read BETWEEN the LINES it clearly is almost like saying ya go ahead and vote for WHOMEVER YOU WANT but they just cant say that or the mindpower/control will be lost. they have SOOO MANY DISTRACTIONs to keep us all happy and busy and do just what they want. they very treat us like we are all individual crazy/guilty persons while the finger remains pointed at us for fear we may turn it around they create laws to keep the majority of us behind bars or hiding indoors for fear of police whom intarigate, harrass and search with no warning at any time for whatever reasons they make up. the country we live in today is not close to what it was created for nor anywhere near compariable to what our founding fathers intended this place to be like. it is almost as if we are commited to kings and its 16th century london but only with technology, womens rights and a grip more rules to follow. emily: It seems like people r 2 rapped up n their own lives to pay attention or even fight whats going on. People r scared to lose their jobs. So many people, r concerned about irrelevant things. So, when u think u found others whom u could join and get some type of march going, they throw in unrelated issues like abortion or whose gonna win the election. We needed to stop this before the election, by the time the election come whats done is done That is true but we as the people need to put a stop to the madness we need to stand together they need us like we need them.",0

"Michele Bachmann's rival reaps benefits of her 'Hardball' comments LA Times, 10/23/08  By P.J. Huffstutter  Reporting from Blaine, Minn. â Elwyn Tinklenberg is living the long-shot candidate's political dream.  There weren't enough chairs for the volunteers crammed inside the four-room campaign office Wednesday morning. Every time aides hit ""refresh"" on their computers, hundreds more online donations appeared. Downstairs, the postal carrier spent 10 minutes trying to cram a two-foot stack of envelopes stuffed with checks into the mail slot.  ""It's been raining money,"" said Beth DeZiel, 39, the campaign's dazed deputy finance director. ""There's so much, we can barely keep up. It's unbelievable.""  But this unsolicited good fortune -- $1.3 million since Friday -- isn't based on anything the Democratic former mayor and grandfather of seven did. It's all because of something his rival, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, said.  On Friday afternoon, Bachmann appeared on MSNBC's ""Hardball with Chris Matthews"" and made what has been dubbed the million-dollar mistake: Bachmann, 52, alleged that presidential candidate Barack Obama may hold ""anti-American"" views, and proposed a media investigation into ""the views of the people in Congress [to] find out: Are they pro-America or anti-America?""  While Sen. Obama's presidential bid has transformed the way campaigns use the Internet to reach volunteers and donors, the technology has also become a way for the public to instantly react -- even to races in which they can't vote.  Those quick reactions, often in the form of donations, can influence the outcome of a campaign, said Julie Barko Germany, director of the Institute for Politics, Democracy & the Internet at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.  Barko German said ""the Internet can be an amplifier,"" enabling viewers to react instantly to something that incites strong support or fury.  ""It's an excellent fundraising tool,"" she added, citing research indicating that ""when you show someone a video online, they donate 10% more.""  Bachmann's interview has turned the race into one of the country's most intensely watched. It also unleashed an online backlash against Bachmann, who many local political observers assumed would easily win reelection.  President Bush won the district in 2004 with 57% of the vote. In 2006, former state Sen. Bachmann was heralded as the first female Republican to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the district, which is dominated by blue-collar and farming communities.  And this summer, one of the few polls conducted in the race showed that Bachmann held a 13-point lead over Tinklenberg.  But on Wednesday, the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled all of its TV advertising supporting Bachmann in the 6th District, according to a GOP source. Since her ""Hardball"" appearance, Bachmann's lawn signs have been vandalized. Callers spew profanity at volunteers and obscenities about the congresswoman at her district campaign office.  Bachmann has retreated from her statements at nearly every campaign stop. She blamed the brouhaha on falling into a ""trap"" she said Matthews laid for her, and on having her words twisted by bloggers.  ""This has been a game of telephone gone into overdrive -- nothing more,"" said Bachmann spokeswoman Michelle Marston. ""A week ago, our competitor had no name identification. If they think that they'll win by throwing a million dollars worth of mud, I can tell you right now it won't be enough.""  Marston said Bachmann's campaign also had seen a jump in contributions, from sympathetic donors who feel she's being unfairly targeted. But Marston said she didn't know the specific amount.  At the time Bachmann was on ""Hardball,"" Tinklenberg was watching a college hockey game and stumping for votes in the bleachers. The cheers drowned out the sound of his cellphone ringing.  ""By the time I looked at it, my voice mail was full,"" said Tinklenberg, 58, who served as Gov. Jesse Ventura's transportation commissioner from 1999 to 2002 and now works as a transportation consultant.  ""It was family, friends, neighbors, supporters,"" Tinklenberg said. ""Everyone was asking, 'Did you see what she said?' ""  Since then, the campaign -- whose eight staff members had gone Dumpster-diving for office furniture and the wire wickets used for lawn signs -- has become flush.  The majority of the funds have come electronically. Of the more than 20,000 online donations, 3,210 came from Minnesota. An additional 2,405 people donated from California, and 2,330 from Texas.  Thousands of people have called the campaign office, offering up their credit card numbers. Some gave the maximum $2,300, but most offered far smaller amounts, $3 or $5, along with a message of support and an apology for not being able to give more.  ""I'm a registered Republican and I have never made contributions to political campaigns,"" wrote one 66-year-old donor. ""I wish I could send more."" In a greeting card with a fuzzy white kitten on the front, another donor wrote, ""What your opponent said on Chris Matthews was sickening! Hope you can defeat her!""  People who said they couldn't afford to give cash have been dropping off food for Tinklenberg and the staff -- platters of apple strudel, pots of chicken noodle soup, paper bags stuffed with oatmeal cookies.  Now, Tinklenberg said, the campaign is trying to find ways to spend so much money in so little time, so he can get out his message on ways to attract jobs, improve public infrastructure and expand public transportation options. His staff is frantically contacting local TV and radio stations to snap up available advertisement spots, installing more phone lines and placing orders for stacks of boxes of campaign literature.  ""I'm not happy she said what she said,"" Tinklenberg said. ""But we certainly are benefiting from it.""

"Palin drags down Republican ticket By DAVID LIGHTMAN SarahPalin has become a drag on the Republican presidential ticket, thefirst time in recent political history that a running mate has madesuch a difference. Among many independents and moderate Republicans,she's raised serious questions about John McCain's judgment, become toomuch of a national punch line and reinforced concerns about McCain'sage. ""Nice lady, no experience. It's so sad. She's a giganticdrag,"" said Chris DePino, a Republican consultant based in New Haven,Conn. The Alaska governor does help the ticket somewhat byenergizing hard-core Republicans, but polls suggest that overall ""she'shurting John McCain,"" said Andrew Kohut, the president of the PewResearch Center. In a nationwide survey Oct. 16-19, Pew foundthat 49 percent of respondents had unfavorable views of Palin, while 44percent saw her favorably. A month earlier, 54 percent had seen herfavorably and 32 percent viewed her negatively. Typically,post-election polls find that vice-presidential choices sway about 1percent of voters. This time, Kohut said, ""we'll get a much biggernumber."" A key reason is that ""the Palin choice reflects poorlyon Senator McCain's judgment,"" said vice presidential expert JoelGoldstein, a professor of law at St. Louis University. Pew foundthat 41 percent of respondents thought McCain showed ""poor judgment""overall, while 29 percent said that of Democratic nominee Barack Obama.While McCain's number isn't solely because of his choice of Palin, herselection was a factor. McCain's age is also a reason for voters'concern about Palin. The Arizona senator is 72 and has had fourinstances of melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. MayoClinic physicians have posted a detailed explanation of McCain'scondition and treatment on his Web site. The prognosis, they said, was""good."" Worries linger, however. ""If something happened toMcCain, she would not be qualified to step in and be president,"" saidAnnette Barron, an independent voter from Altamonte Springs, Fla. Palinalso has hurt herself by becoming largely invisible to the generalpublic, except when she got media attention for starting controversies- such as charging that Obama was ""palling around with terrorists"" - orfor receiving $150,000 in clothing and accessories from the RepublicanParty. She also unabashedly identifies herself with the party's conservative wing, alienating moderates. ""Itreinforced the notion that John McCain cared little about people likeme,"" said former Maine state Rep. Sherry Huber, a Republican who backedMcCain in the primary but now supports Obama. ""She clearly does notshare the values I and other moderate Republicans do."" ProminentRepublicans have echoed that idea. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one ofMcCain's closest friends, suggested that Sen. Joseph Lieberman, anindependent Democrat from Connecticut, would have brought independentsto the ticket. Last week, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge said thathad McCain picked him, the Republican Party would have had a bettershot at winning his state. Then there's Palin's image problembecause of what vice-presidential expert Timothy Walch called ""thealbatross of American comedy."" ""Every time (comedian) Tina Feyappeared on TV imitating her, it diminished Palin,"" said Walch, thedirector of the Herbert Hoover presidential library. ""For somebodyessentially unknown, she's diminished when she becomes a caricature ofherself."" In most election years, Palin would have been afootnote, like controversial vice-presidential choices Spiro Agnew in1968 or Dan Quayle 20 years later. Both were lightly regarded buttriumphed on winning tickets. However, Goldstein, of St. LouisUniversity, noted that in 1968, Richard Nixon was 55, so the prospectof an Agnew presidency seemed dim. In 1988, Quayle ran with George H.W.Bush, who was essentially running for President Reagan's third termagainst unpopular Democrat Michael Dukakis. In 2008, Goldsteinsaid, Obama ""has convinced a broad cross-section of the American peoplehe's presidential,"" so Palin gives swing voters who are warming to theIllinois senator one more reason to move away from McCain. As forPalin's expected appeal to women, Sieglinde Warren, a teachingsupervisor from Poland, Ohio, was a Clinton supporter who now backsObama. Palin and Clinton don't compare, she said, because ""Clinton hadsome substance I could relate to."" (EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM) Tobe sure, Palin has had some positive impact on the campaign. McCain hadnever been a favorite of strict conservatives, as he challengedRepublican orthodoxy over the years on tax cuts, campaign finance,climate change and other topics. The Republican base loves Palin. ""Somany people can relate to her. She really appeals to everydayhousewives, people who go out and hunt, and people who have done greatthings in their life,"" said Bob Dodge, a retired communicationsengineer in Sarasota, Fla. And don't tell Jennifer Tarman, aBradenton, Fla., medical assistant, that Palin, who's been a governorsince December 2006, isn't qualified. ""She's more qualified thanObama,"" she said. Obama's been a U.S. senator since January 2005, buthas spent most of the past two years campaigning for the White House. Still, the experts and a lot of swing voters agree with Goldstein. ""She's made it much more difficult for McCain,"" he said. ON THE WEB John McCain's medical records: http://www.johnmccain.com/mccainrecords/",0
"Ha yea her speeches are written yet three McCain political consultants went on national television complaining that Palin was not giving the responses written for her..damn her for having a mind of her own..do you really believe that people who take chances and make something of themselves should give half of their earnings to the people who take advantage of the government handouts..please explain how that makes any sense..my father is a small business owner.. He worked for 15 years as a draftsman and project manager making just enough to support his three children and wife..He took advantage of the fact that he lives in the greatest country in the world and started his own business..it was only by the grace of god and a few good friends that he made it through the first years of business..His contracting business is now a corporation and he does make over 250k a year..he lives in a three bedroom 1k sq.foot home with his wife and I. pretty average..yet he pays %40 of what he makes in one year to the government to support the nigger sitting on the street with her three children on welfare..yea i guess you think thats ""american""",0
I think the news media is pushing Obama because they remember how many news papers sold during the Clinton Years...,0
oh yea..please list Obama's accomplishments and level of experience..then research Palin and do the same..Its prettyt sad to think our candidate for vice president has more experience than your presidential candidate..,0
 Well at least you tried; it is sad that individuals post about someoneâs experience and forget the candidate they are voting for has less.,0
    Really?   Obama: Running local community projects.  12 years of State/National political experience.    Palin: 10 years city experience. 2 years state experience.     I guess if running a small city is now more important than passing state legislation...,0
"Sarah Palin is INCOMPETENT and Unqualified!   Ohh no, what gave her away, yes but McCain says her hubby Todd is a strong and will make a good second man because he raced his snowmobile with a broken arm..  Ohh mannn lmao",0
"Please use the little intelligence you do have and read up about your candidate. Even her own advisers dissent about her qualifications.  A Palin associate and McCain adviser, according to CNN, defended their strategy of limiting Palinâs interaction with the media because âshe was not ready and that the missteps could have been a lot worse.â  ""Her lack of fundamental understanding of some key issues was dramatic,"" said another McCain source with direct knowledge of the process to prepare Palin after she was picked. The source said it was probably the ""hardest"" to get her ""up to speed than any candidate in history.""  Read more about it @ http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/27/palin.tension/index.html",0

"    Last I checked, the Vice President, as a position, has no direct executive responsibilities. In fact, it is more of a legislative job. Maybe she is running for the wrong position?",0
" Really? So someone didn't come up with Joe six-pack or Catie Citizen or Tito the Builder or any of those other cute nicknames she uses to describe the US masses? Those stereotypes are all hers? What about the constant lectures about Obama and Biden instead of Answering the questions about her foreign and economic policies? Really? That was all her huh, well, now my confidence in her is even lower.... Thanks!",0
ever heard of socialism?? racism?? yes black people can be racist too..,0
   Haahahahhahahahah now that was funnyy lmao,0
"Sarah Palin has more executive experience than Barack Obama ... Joe Biden and guess who? John McCain.  Please stop using that talking point as if it were valid. Using that same argument your unqualified VP has more experience than John McCain who has never managed anything.  George W. Bush has more Executive experience than John McCain in 2000 and we all know how that turned out.  She was managed a state of 600k people, not even 1 million. According to those standards ... Mayors, not Governors, have managed a staff and population greater than Alaska. Barack Obama, as a senator, has more constituents in his district than Palin in her state.  Do you see how flawed your argument becomes?",0
  OWNED!! You rock!  *applause*,0
ok Obama has managed city projects?? I worked harder to coach a little league team..he did NOTHING..oh yea and you do realize you're comparing a presidential candidate to a v.p. candidate..you act like he isn't a radical and a racist..his own pastor admitted it!!,0
"She's constantly being told what to, what to say, etc. Rightly, so. She's a complete retard! Didn't MCain know what he was getting himself into when choosing this chick?? When she speaks for herself...horrible things happen for the GOP candidate. They should have known better!   CNN) -- Some aides to Sen. John McCain say they weren't happy that running mate Sarah Palin went off script Sunday and turned attention back to the controversy over her wardrobe.",0
"Several McCain advisers suggested that they have become increasingly frustrated with what one aide described as Palin ""going rogue.""",0
She's a maverick.   *wink*,0
"I love this line in the article:  ""A Palin aide, however, told CNN that the governor clearly felt like she had to say something to defend herself, because ""that's really not who she is.""    What's that old saying? If it walks like a duck.....   I don't care that the RNC paid for the wardrobe and it was not illegal. I find it excessive and wasteful. Furthermore; her attempt(s) to justify it are lame.",0
"It is possible that Palin's strengths as a personality were not capitalized properly by the McCain campaign. Her expensive makeover, for example, might not have been so radically necessary if the idea were to push the hockey mom image more.  But I think there are some pretty obvious reasons why the campaign wants to control Palin rather tightly. Upon introduction of Palin, the talk was as if Obama and Palin were the ones directly contesting for office.  This obviously would be damaging to McCain so you would have to think that McCain's advisers would want to redirect the focus on the main candidate and, also, bring Palin under wing in terms of talking points ... the way that the McCain advisers see the issues to be.  Rollins refers to the problem as mishandling Palin which does not underscore whether he saw Palin as an asset for substantive issues.  Bill Kristol, an early and still vocal champion of Palin feels that she should have been let loose to just speak her mind ... within bounds, presumably.  Either way, her role was to keep the hopes of a major BOP base alive and active and she has done that.  That there are GOP opinion leaders that have moved away from the campaign to support Obama isn't simply a matter of Palin having been mishandled, imo.",0
"  Personally, I rather think that, like it or not, if one is voting for McCain for POTUS, one is also, essentially, voting for Palin for the same office, at some point. 72 is a seasoned age, and it could be argued that the John McCain of 72 is far from the John McCain of 64. At any rate, the chances of Palin stepping into the position some time in the next 4 years is significant.  That having been said, this is the woman who flatly stated that the VPOTUS runs the Senate, and can really get in there and mix it up and change things with the senators.  *shudder*",0
Like I said before. Get a time machine and bring McCain 00 back from the past to beat the snot out of McCain 08.,0
  QFT.,0
"   Oh, from the outside looking in, you're right.  But from inside the McCain campaign ... the notion that a candidate runs with a verity that he may die due to his age and health in office isn't in the playbook. So it is McCain first, Palin second and only in a supporting role.  Palin stealing headlines from Obama is one thing but also pushing McCain off the headlines is not acceptable.  It was important to get the base back with him because his position with them hasn't always been a totally warm and fuzzy experience. Palin was the answer, it seems. The question really is, though, how big is that base today compared to previous elections?  Vocal, the base may be but how many are still in that base? I have my doubts that it is as big as it once was. It is still sizable and McCain needs them to have a prayer of chance of winning but I am a little skeptical about its current size partly because of Palin and what her stronpoints at re-activating that base happen to be.",0
"  Good point, as always, old friend.",0
" Well I think they tried that and every time she did, she got hung. To many big words for her.",0
"The Palins was supposed to be tactical...what happened?  Her adorable-ness when out the door as soon as opened her mouth. She needed more time to prepare for a situation like this. It seems like she has know idea what she's talking about 1/2 the time. It's sad...yet scary to think...  She had no idea what she was getting herself into...and now she's unknowingly destroying the GOP's chances.  Poor McCain. Well, at least the Reps gave him his chance before he kicked the bucket.",0

i watched 'a knights tale' last night but to me paul bettany is the better one in it.,0
"He was good in 'I'm Not There', though Cate Blanchett stole the movie with her performance. I think he was a bit over rated for his actual body of work.",0
" If he hadn't died, his performance as the Joker would have been the start of something really big for him. The Dark Knight seems to have spurred many, many people who never saw a Heath Ledger movie before to go back and review his earlier work.",0
Heath was an always be the definitive JOKER....,0
Brokeback Mountain was a beautiful film.,0
  that movie is fucking fantastic,0
Ya he was great but i am gonna be better ha ha ha!,0
Best thing about TDk if you ask me.,0
Heath was ok... I thought Jack Nicholson was a really good Joker though.,0
"I don't know what the big deal was about the Dark Knight, batman's voice was stupid and over done and heath ledger did a horrible job. Im glad he died. Nothing beats Jack Nickolson's performance of the Joker",0
  so many things wrong with what you just said.  you are a fucking douchebag for being glad that Ledger is dead and Ledger was great in it.,0
"All he did was lick his lips and stuttered like he had something in his ass, not so great.",0
"Oh, and you live in California. Lotta douchebags out there.",0
  haha... Welcome to the movie forum!  If you say you didn't like TDK... All the trolls and fanboys come out of the woodwork to defends Heaths' half ass potrayal of the Joker.  Get used to it... (apparently it's all they got):(,0
"  Heath's Joker was the closest to Joker in the comics. I suggest you read The Killing Joker, and you'll understand.  Heath is how the Joker was originally written. Jack's Joker was how DC changed him back in the 50's and 60's where they made him more a practical joker then a homicidal mad man.  But to each their own.",0
" Ok Johnnie. You and the dumbass that you're defending need to go back and read the previous posts that said dumbass contributed to this thread.  Those posts are what makes him a dumbass, not the fact that he doen't like TDK.",0
"  One of his lesser known movies. He was good in it. His career was barely taking off though, and to be bad he passed away at such a young age.",0
"  You come off as a jerk because you said that you're glad Heath's dead because you didn't like his performance in The Dark Knight. It's ok if you didn't like the movie or Heath's performance, but to say that you're glad he's dead is what makes someone say you have a low IQ.",0
"  In career terms that's the tragic thing about his death, that he seemed to be coming into his own as a great actor.",0
  I'd say fully emerging yourself into a character that has serious mental issues is a lot more traumatizing than playing a character that has a homosexual relationship.,0
" I never saw it....:(....I love skater movies, too...hmm...why did I not see this?",0
" I saw some interview with Nicholson when Ledger died...he said he had warned him about the character...or something like that...I think if you get that run down by a character, you are a kook to begin with...and maybe should lay off the narcotics",0
  You're better off just watching 'Dogtown and Z-Boys'.,0
 that one I saw ;),0
  Is it a good movie? I DVRed it the other night and haven't gotten around to it. I plan on watching a lot of movies today . . .ÃÂ to escape all the election coverage.,0
"  also, a fantastic documentary :)",0
" I've seen it a few times, well worth renting/buying.",0
You guys seriously think he died over the Joker role? Didn't the medical report say it was the wrong mix of sleeping pills? There was no excess amount in his body.,0
"He wasn't just a great joker, he was a great actor all around, i really liked him in all the roles that i saw him in, Especially in ""10 Things I Hate About You""",0
  no it's because you don't give a good reason why Heath Ledger didn't do a good job.,0
  *didn't,0
 Yeah it is a good film. It left me feeling sad when it ended. Well worth watching :),0
"You guys are dumbasses, he didn't die because he got too into the role, thats just silly. He died of brain cancer because he was on the cell phone to much and he over dosed on sleeping pills.",0

That justice for all walks of life will be sought, even for those who most do not agree with, the homosexual, the atheist, the Muslim, the Black, the Hispanic, and all other forms of minority justice will prevail under the harsh punitive injustices of the Christian White majority. That the poor elderly will no longer suffer under the unfulfillable greed of insurance or hospital HMO's. That the dream of Americanism has now been given to those willing to work for it, and not in the hands of the Fortune 500 executives. Prosperity, growth, and equality have been returned to the great justice that is the USA.  No more religious oppression, no more religious division, no more governmental failures of misunderstanding. Tonight, America has joined together and spoke with one monstrous roar, that equality doesn't just stop at law. Shed America has of it's racial shell, it's religious shell, and regrets of mistakes of slavery long past.",0
 Is that sarcasm?,0
  I'm not surprised...it's big enough. The question is...why is he looking at my ass?,0
amen! let's bring in an era where people think with their minds and not with their bleeding heart. let's strive for a time of tolerance and acceptance. i am so happy i'm almost crying. God bless America. wow.,0

"  Ignorance Ã¢â°Â  dumb. In all fairness to Palin, she had a few months to sell the American people. Obama has had 2 years. She kind of half answered the elementary school kid by saying that the VP is the leader of the Senate. I didn't expect her to get into particulars with a kid.",0
"This is actually a really good thread, I hope it gets some responses. I was thinking this exact same thing today.  The conversational limbo that probably exists in young black republican circles today has got to be pretty loud.",0
Black republicans? You'll have better luck finding a black leprechaun.,0

  LOL..I wouldn't expect to find a whole lot of Republicans of any race today.,0
"  I guess some guy saw a post I left somewhere, because he was trying very hard to recruit me.  Hit my in box with whole bunch of links, and tried to get all buddy buddy talking about video games.  I lean to the right on a lot of issues (mostly financial, not the cultural stuff) but I have never given it any serious consideration.",0
  No you're not...a black republican that is.,0
  Good for you!! What made you decide to vote for him?,0
"  That's funny...lol ""black leprechaun""..But trust me, there are some out there. Just ask Fox News. And besides, one of the local news channels was able to find one when they went to the local Republican Party watch Party last night. They asked this one black guy who claimed to be Republican how he felt and he said that he was sad but that ""it is what it is..."" I wish I could find him and ask him how he really feels...",0
i managed to have both of those feelings simultaneously this morning. it was weird.,0
"I'll try to answer the question the way my good friend who is a black republican that voted for mccain answered.  In her own words, the discomfort of having an unqualified President far outweighs the cultural achievment of America having elected the first black President. She also said the fact that American's are making such a huge deal about his race only makes her less impressed with the accomplishment.  She said when we have a black President that isn't constantly refered to as the First Black President then they will be more pride in the accomplishment.",0
  When McCain 2008 turned out to be a shadow of McCain 2004 AND his pick Sarah Palin. Some of Obama's policy ideas appeal to me and the way he ran his campaign showed REAL LEADERSHIP,0
"  yeah...i'm a republican and i voted for obama. i'm just sayin is anyone not sick of the same thing? try something new. don't be afraid to step outside the box. Obama is going to do great things. you and your ""friend"" will see.",0
"  Her argument is very bogus. How can one not make a big deal about him being the first black president. She is only saying this because he is not republican or conservative. If it had been Colin Powell (who was being heavily recruited) would she be more impressed? But the media would still make a big deal of his race, because it is historic, regardless of what Party the person comes from....I always laugh when people say they want us to live in a color-blind society: the fact is that people do see color, the question is can you be mature enough to not let it cloud your judgment? The fact that race did not play a huge fact in this election is testament to how far we have come....",0
"  Interesting. I think Palin hurt McCain a little bit and it was sad to see McCain pander to the base of his party, but I think more than anything else it was the failures of George W. Bush that got Obama elected..",0
"   I seriously doubt Barack X will do anything ""GREAT"".  His election will only be ""HISTORIC"" cause hes black.  and this thread proves it.",0
"   This was a conversation we had about a month ago, and I haven't talked to her since the results were official, but I would image her opinion is still the same.  We were in a mall and this guy stopped us (i was her and a white guy that had an obama shirt on) and he asked us what basically the same question you did, and that's how you answered.  I didn't want to debate her in the mall so I didn't say anything, but I think there obviously is a cultural significance, but I don't know if its a Jackie Robinson type of accomplishment. His accomplishment was ending the ban on black players. Obama isn't breaking down a legal barrier, but it is a social barrier.  IDK, I'm more looking forward to the change he'll bring than his color though.",0
  Why did you stop with Barack X? You forgot the Barack Hussein Obama. I cannot get over thehuge irony that here we are in a war with Islamo-fascists and we elect a president named Barack Hussein Obama. hahahahaha. I love it...,0
"  I'm not a republican, she is.",0
"   but race did play a huge part in this election for a lot of people (whether it be for positive or negative reasons). i understand his friend's mentality.  it will definitely be historical and it is certainly something to be proud of, but it was not the first step and it should not be the last.  the real accomplishment will be the day that an african-american, female, asian, gay, atheist, muslim, (ect) president is not considered a change.  this wouldn't mean we are color-blind, it would mean we are finally accepting.",0
"   Racists often do.  Im not confused. Hes no MLK wannabe, hes a Malcolm X wannabe.  Thats why jesse wanted to cut his nuts off.  Thats why his spiritual mentor, quotes Malcolm X, and hangs out with Louis Farrakahn.  Hes no christian.",0
"    I agree that race should not play a role. I voted for McCain not because of race, so don't act like people who didn't vote for Barack are not mature enough. I have heard two of my best friends (african americans) tell me they were voting for Barack because he is black. Is that not racist? Could I say I voted for McCain because he is white?? We got in many arguements about this but still remain friends because we dont spew hate at each other but intellectual differences. We definately not living in color blind society. Hell I just got done listening to Al Sharpton continue to live in a race based society. He is not savior on black issues, but a problem. My friends even said that Al Sharpton does not speak for them and shouldn't speak for every african american.",0
"  Well, you are entitled to your opinion. But need I remind you, your argument assumes that all Christians are saints and all Muslims are demons, and that in of itself is not true..",0
"  I agree, voting for Obama because he is black and ONLY for that reason is dumb. My reasoning was more along the lines of how Colin Powell came to his conclusion. I honestly do like John McCain and I really hate that his campaign took the turn that he did and he ceased being the 2000 maverick that he once was. His speech last night reminded me of the John McCain that many people love..",0
"   You said that not me. I never said anything of the kind.  I know plenty of Muslims, and they think Farakahn and Wright are a coupla nut bags. They voted for McCain by the way.  One family owns 2 liquor stores and a gas station and theyve only lived in this country for 10 years. This was thier first US election as voting citizens.  They really thought Americans were gonna kill them after 9/11, and they live in Massachusetts. They pulled thier children outta school cause the other school kids were pretty mean.",0
"   The President of the United States, is the most powerful man on the planet.  He can erase, COUNTRIES, with a word.  Im just glad Barack X has so much experience.  Now I know, I can trust him.",0
   black republicans?  you could say republicans.,0
 You are as much of a Republican as I am a Democrat. I wave the B.S flag.,0
"    to be 100 percent honest, I was never a huge McCaing supporter either. I just thought that some of Obama policies were terrible for our country. It has nothing to do with him, but rather the policies and beliefs that his party. Saying that, I think we can both agree that there is no perfect candidate for president. Every American has a view of what their perfect president would be and they all differ. I am wholeheartedly rooting for America to pick itself up and get this country going, but this blaming the problem on republicans or democrats is illogical.  I am happy that people can elect a black president I just wish his policies aligned with my views. Oh well, in all reality, I am still going to finish college, keep working, and the president cannot control that. I am only going to worry about what I can control which is my own life.",0
i woud also like to add that no matter what we say here...... Barack Obama is our next prez. If you don't like it you can always leave :-),0

"Here is oneâ¦prove that Past present and further donât really exists, that the perception of âtimeâ is simply just conciseness, ability to process information and memory.",0
"This is a rather fun one that I always wanted to do. Even though most winners at science fairs are biology projects this one is still way cool and is a physics one.    You measure the speed of light. Here is what you need a microwave (without the automatic turn table), some chocolate or cheese, an accurate ruler (measurements in milimeters), a plate.    What you do is break up the cheese or chacolate and spread it up along the plate. Put it in the microwave and turn it on... observe it and wait for small parts of it to melt. This phenomina happens because the microwaves which are inside your microwave oven form a standing wave. This is why you have to stir food in it to cook it or have a turn table, or have you ever noticed how one bit will be real hot, and then the bite right next to it will be ice cold? The goal is to let it form a few hot spots that melt the cheese in those places. Then you want to take a ruler and measure the distance between each of the hotspots. You now know the wavelength of microwaves, it will be best to convert this length into meters (it will be like .005 meters or something like that though) . Now to figure out the speed of light    c = speed of light (electromagnetic radiation)  l = wavelength of the light  f = frequency of the light    The equation is as follows    c = l*f    You measured l, now to get f, look on the back of the microwave and look for the frequency of the waves. It will probably be in MHz or something like that (I don't remember the frequencies of microwaves off the top of my head). Mulitply l times f and you have just figured out the speed of light!",0

"Duckweed. Use duckweed. It produces a shitload of protein . I did something about the effects of different fertilizers (including guppy poop...ever try to figure out the nitrogen composition of guppy shit?).

I don't mind a few things here and there, but when you don't make the bed, when you throw laundry on top of it, when i can't have a friend in the house because i'm embarassed that there's underwear and bras strewn on the bed, pillows on the floor, that's something else. You used to be good about at least making the bed.",0
