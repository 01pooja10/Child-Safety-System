"  No, blacks were not given access to credit and property in the manner that whites were due to racism. In the 60's many black neighborhoods were destroyed to make the interstate highway system, the replacement was high density public housing. In 68, when king died blacks destroyed their own commercial centers, but these were OWNED by whites and rented to blacks. That was part of the anger, to this day most of these places are still just as they were after the riots. In combination with the drugs that were imported into the cities by Regean to destroy the black pride movement, these things destroyed confidence and morale in the black community, causing them to blame the man. Most of the children from the 70's grew up to be either cynical adults, or backstabbers to the ppl they left behind when they made it, like Barrack and Michelle Obama.",0

Only maybe, but worth a shot. Even if they didn't give up their client, just said that someone else confessed to the crime. What I don't get is why they didn't do it after their client got convicted. He was done for anyway.",0

"Stanley Kubrick, and seeing ""Clockwork Orange"" as a teenager were what made me start to study film as a potential art form, not just the Hollywood products shoved into release dates that I was used to up until that point (and that, more and more, movies tend towards now). It was just so unique and powerful, and in a way, through its own antisocial nature, it gave me the strength to get through those uncertain high school years, where I often felt caged up and institutionalized like Alex. A lot of people didn't understand it, wrote it off as too weird or disturbing (which it is, certainly was at the time, though times have changed), but then it's not meant to be a family film. I wrote like 2 papers on it in college.    Although I for one think filmmakers are far too casual with releasing Special Edition DVD versions of movies these days, there's one movie where it'd be really nice to see just that, so we might have something with promotional materials and essays and documentaries detailing its influence and transition to the screen, and with any luck, a commentary by Malcolm McDowell and Jan Harlan detailing their thoughts about it, and Kubrick himself (RIP, Stan).",0

"VIVA la RESISISTANCE(but4real this time dude) Body: Is It Time for a Rebellion? October 20, 2008 ""50 percent NO and 50 percent HELL NO!""--Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va. ) on feedback received from his constituents regarding Congress' bailout package Mere days after President Bush signed into law an $810 billion bailout bill aimed at rescuing the Wall Street financiers, one of the recipients, American International Group Inc., threw a $440,000 bash for its executives at a swanky resort, complete with spa treatments, banquets and golf outings. At the same time that AIG execs were celebrating lavishly, indirectly at taxpayer expense, nearly 12 million American taxpayers, who owed more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, were in danger of foreclosure. As if it weren't bad enough that a fiscally irresponsible corporate America is going to be bailed out at taxpayer expense, Congress included more than $100 billion in pork barrel projects in the bill. Nothing short of congressional bribes, these so-called inducements range from an exemption from excise tax for wooden arrows designed for use by children and tax write-offs for motorsports racing track facility owners to tax rebates on rum imported from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as imported wool. This is not relief, it is economic slavery. It has become increasingly clear that the greatest threat to our freedoms--and our bank accounts--does not lurk outside our borders. Rather, it prowls among us, in the form of a government of wolves that is running wild and riding roughshod over our freedoms. There was a time when such a blatant disregard for the burden being laid upon the American taxpayer would have elicited howls of outrage, protest marches and perhaps even outright rebellion. Today, however, many Americans understandably feel helpless to do anything about their plight. After all, despite the fact that calls and emails to congressional offices were overwhelmingly against the $810 billion pork-laden bailout, the legislation passed anyway. Yet consider this: at its core, the quest for the American dream is about gaining sovereignty over one's life and property. Without it, there can be no freedom. While we have become accustomed to equating property with land ownership, the term is much more fundamental and personal. It refers to a kind of sovereignty over one's life and possessions--especially one's money. Questions about who has ultimate control over our money, how much of it can be claimed by government and how it gets spent go to the heart of the battle over property rights. Governments generate no wealth on their own. Any resources that they have at their disposal have been appropriated from the original producers of that wealth, the citizens. This fundamental truth has largely been forgotten over the years. Yet the government's respect for and treatment of the property of its citizens often reflects its attitude regarding its citizens' rights as a whole. Conversely, a government that doesn't respect the rights of its citizens will have even less regard for their property--be it land, money or personhood. With the Wall Street bailout, the President and Congress simply disregarded the clear will of the people. And while secret agreements were obviously made and backroom bargains struck, the Constitution and our rights were not even given a second thought. However, those who wrote the Constitution drafted our founding document with the intention of ensuring that the power of government remained with the people. The Framers wanted citizens to know what the government is doing and how it spends taxpayer funds. And if the elected officials aren't doing their jobs or the people disagreed with their performance, the Framers empowered the people to unseat their representatives. Without these safeguards, there is no representative government. Since the country's inception, America has been synonymous with the concept that there are certain individual rights and freedoms that no one, not even government agents, can violate. As the Declaration of Independence boldly proclaims: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. "" These were revolutionary ideas in an age of kings and serfdoms, and they served as a springboard for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These rights were considered absolute and so precious that no government can violate them. And the early American colonists believed these principles were not only worth fighting for, they were worth dying for. One of these was the right of the people to change or do away with a government that attempts to undermine their rights. As the Declaration concludes, ""whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. "" Governments are brought into being to protect our rights. When they systematically violate them, the people have a right--nay, a duty--to resist. This was the true spirit of 1776 that moved the American colonists to start a revolution against a government that was violating their rights. This willingness to stand and fight against corrupt government was what it meant to be an American in our nation's early years. And if we truly want to be Americans today, it will mean practicing every form of nonviolent resistance available to us as citizens--including picketing, mass protests, sit-ins, boycotts and so on. It will certainly take more than voting for or against a particular politician. Thomas Jefferson was right: ""What country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance?"" Available online at: http://www. rutherford. org/articles_db/commentary. asp?record_id=559 Exactly dude thats what i been tripping on for to long!! we have to take action its getting worse all the time!!! any ideas for putting together a meeting of some sort? maybe finding hella people who see it like that too so we can all change this country back to what we were supposed to stand up for, so we represent and stand for what we were meant to stand up for. how often are elections started with an idea that we, the actual people, has decided? we are brain washed into believing we are making the important decisions when in all actualites THEY,[the ""president""(our king) and his noble mary men(the government end elected political officials] give US preselected canidates to vote on so ""we"" choose witch of the presented options THEY give US. So they this play mind-fuck game where people truely do believe we as the worlds free people are together deciding through this little""what do u wanna do huny? u decide""ol' trick: much like a parent gives a child, you can pick!! a., b., c., or d. its YOUR decision you pick... WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE: not even in fine print, BUT if u read BETWEEN the LINES it clearly is almost like saying ya go ahead and vote for WHOMEVER YOU WANT but they just cant say that or the mindpower/control will be lost. they have SOOO MANY DISTRACTIONs to keep us all happy and busy and do just what they want. they very treat us like we are all individual crazy/guilty persons while the finger remains pointed at us for fear we may turn it around they create laws to keep the majority of us behind bars or hiding indoors for fear of police whom intarigate, harrass and search with no warning at any time for whatever reasons they make up. the country we live in today is not close to what it was created for nor anywhere near compariable to what our founding fathers intended this place to be like. it is almost as if we are commited to kings and its 16th century london but only with technology, womens rights and a grip more rules to follow. emily: It seems like people r 2 rapped up n their own lives to pay attention or even fight whats going on. People r scared to lose their jobs. So many people, r concerned about irrelevant things. So, when u think u found others whom u could join and get some type of march going, they throw in unrelated issues like abortion or whose gonna win the election. We needed to stop this before the election, by the time the election come whats done is done That is true but we as the people need to put a stop to the madness we need to stand together they need us like we need them.",0

"Gas prices did go down. Or better said, the gas guzzlers went down south... of the border.   The US and Mexican press had a field day sensationalizing the events for several months, which in turn greatly affected tourism and Bajaâs economy as over 40 percent of the Baja coastal region depends on tourism. Baja has experienced the economic pain that also punctuates for them the great binational economic interdependence.  Now it seems that despite the media fervor in reporting and sensationalizing Mexicoâs problems with drug capos, Americans are flocking back to Baja. Why?  Saving money, trumps fear. Gasoline prices now over $4.50 a gallon in San Diego is available anywhere in Baja for around $2.55 a gallon. And the stampede of US trucks buying diesel fuel at $2.20 a gallon versus over $5 a gallon in San Diego, has caught Baja shorthanded an unable to keep up with the demand. Once again the economic interdependence is evident.  Robert Kline from Orange County waiting to fuel up his Ford pickup said that once he began reading and seen on nightly news about all the cars crossing for gas, he figured things canât be that bad, so he decided to come back to Baja that was his favorite weekend retreat. Like Kline, others are beginning to see that things are OK, and they too will begin to travel to Baja. So things will go back to normal during the summer months.  http://hispanicvista.com/HVC/Columnist/posiojr/070608Patrick_Osi o.htm  BTW Mexico's gas prices go up only by inflation rate, where here in the US they are set by the individual sellers (companies).",0

"  I didn't say all republicans are racist, what I said rather, was that the republican party has a history of racism. Also, the republican party is in denial about this and this is exactly why most blacks will not vote for a republican.  If you read the article, the author suggests that it is a good thing that Bush is reaching out to black voters finally, but it will not work until the republican party adresses it's racism in the past.  I've yet to hear a good reason for Reagan to deliver his initial campaign speech, repleat with overtones of states rights vs federal rights, in Philadelphia, MI, the exact town in which three civil rights workers were murdered in one of the 1960s' ugliest cases of racist violence. It was a ringing declaration of his support for ""states' rights"" â a code word for resistance to black advances clearly understood by white Southern voters.  If this wasn't race baiting, what was it? Please explain.",0

We dont really even get a choice because chances are both sides of the race are going to be scumbag bile.

Opposite of subprime  CRA-motivated loans tend to be the opposite of subprime loans, most of which were issued by mortgage brokers and mortgage companies and financed by investment banks, none of which were covered by the CRA.  Here's more evidence that you've been hoodwinked. This information was collected by the Center for Responsible Lending:  â¢ The CRA was effective long before the subprime market existed.  â¢ The CRA has been around for three decades and the financial instruments that allowed the subprime mortgage industry to rise and crash came into existence within the past five years.  â¢ Investment banks, not the federal government, had the appetite for risky loans.  The Wall Street-based market for reselling subprime created the demand for riskier loans. Because the debt would be sold into the market and not kept on the lender's books, many lenders did not bother to verify a borrower's income or assess ability to repay the loan.",0

Bush was a bad choice for president because:  * He can't speak off the cuff - a requirement for a national leader.  * He made Condi Rice Secretary of State.  * He hasn't released information on terrorism and the war in Iraq that would justify many of his actions.  The U.S. lost in Vietnam because the leftist press turned the country agaisnt the war, calling the Tet offensive a win for the NVA when it was a huge loss.ÃÂ  They are trying to do the same in Iraq.

"Hollywood is seeing the Bollywood effect at the moment. The architect about how a movie comes to be made has changed drastically in Hollywood over the last decade. Churn out lots of movies and they only have to be ok in quality. Turn a modest profit at the box office because the B.O. is now a secondary revenue stream to the direct sell-through DVD, PPV, Foreign Distribution and cable TV markets.  Hollywood used to be a talent based industry -- Audiences would go see movies for the talent (actors; directors) even more than they do now. However, now it is a packaged goods industry on the studio side where talent takes a back seat to the movie itself (the high concept), and why marketing the movie is more important than anything else. A movie's main theatrical run is now just a 110 minute commercial for the eventual DVD release where it can make 10x its B.O. take.  Teens still go to the movies each weekend which throws a whole other dimension into the mix and is why most of the products offered cater to this demographic.  So... How does this explain movies just being not as good as the ones in previous years from a strictly business perspective?  The emphasis isn't on quality anymore. It's on quantity.  There will be 100 movies, big and small, coming out this summer of 2008. That's just a four month period (May-August). Consider how many movies come out PER YEAR (in the U.S.) and this is proof the focus is now on market saturation and not the quality of the product. Also, consider over half (50%) of those movies released each year are remakes and or based on previously proven properties like novels and comic books.  Studios can get away with this approach because a lot of these movies aren't made for very much, so when they do strike B.O. gold -- Like ""Juno"" -- They can maximize the profits.  Most of your smaller movies have budgets of less than $40 million which is why they can afford to fail at the B.O. because they will easily make that back through DVD rentals. These days, there are only a few, tent pole pictures studios are willing to sink a lot of money ($100-$300 million per picture) into. These are your franchise pictures like the household comic book movies, high concept stuff like ""Transformers"" etc. -- Properties that coincidentally also have cross-promotional tie-ins (toys, video games, fast food, cell phone, etc.) to help finance the films.  It is this emphasis on quantity that is effecting what is produced, movies don't have to be ""good"" anymore. They just have to be on the market and interest you in the DVD. Because once you buy or rent the DVD, even if the movie ""sucks"" you've already spent your money and that is what the studios and theater owners want.  But to say all movies are garbage this decade is pure idiocy. This decade has seen many future classics in their respected genres...from all around the world.",0

  Well that is a good example of a black voter taking control of the situation rather than being controlled by the situation. I just ask this question just in case it might turn out that way. I just hope black voters will still turn out for Hillary even though it has been a rough primary. Hillary really did not have a choice but to be on the offensive against Obama and throw the kitchen sink at him due to the fact that Obama did take her by surprise with overwhelming victories after Super Tuesday. But it is definitely in Obama's favor right now to be the nominee. Good luck to all candidate.,0

"The original ""The Wicker Man""   THE 1973 ORIGINAL VERSION NOT the Remake.     I didn't see the remake but Im going to assume this was the ending:  Nicholas Cage jumps out of the wicker man at the last moment that its burning, performs Krag Maga on the village leader and several of the other pagans, disarming his gun taking it and grabbing the girl, Nick C. then gets into a car for a long car chase sequence with villagers in pursuit in their cars, with a hail of bullets following him, he crashes through a random fruit stand. Drives under a semi-truck, turning the car into a convertable, the cars following him crash into it. Then he slams into a firetruck which explodes. It seems like all is lost as the pagans surround a bruised and tattered and burned Nick Cage trapped in his car. Then the sound of helicopter blades:  Miraculously the ATF shows up in helicopters. ATF paratroupers leap out on rope ladders. The ATF burns the entire town to the ground like Waco. At the end of the movie a battlescarred Nickolas Cage, exhausted out of breath, gets praised by the leading ATF Commander (who is also Nick's dad) something like ""Good job son, sorry I doubted you in Waco""   Then the credits roll, and some lame rap music plays with these lyrics: ""Wicka, wicka, wicka; my n$gga, n$gga, n$gga""",0

"I found the article on this link:  http://glipress.blogspot.com/2008/05/review-13-rule-breaking-fil ms.html  The author is obviously passionate about film, and makes some good points.  Although I think there's too much attention paid to The Empire Strikes Back, which I do not view as a groundbreaking film, sorry.  Time Code is a cheap gimmick movie, and very hard to watch for more than 10 minutes.  Requiem for a Dream is not the first anti-drug movie.  And, as groundbreaking films go, where was Citizen Kane?  I would have also mentioned Metropolis, M, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, Anatomy of a Murder, Blade Runner, Rope, and several silent films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari & The Passion of Joan of Arc if I was talking about films with a notable influence years after they were made.",0

"Obviously you didnt read what I wrote, it was an example.  Can you imagine Indiana Jones played by anyone other than Harrison Ford. Can you imagine Indy played by Tom Sellick because thats who the part was written as and for, Magnum PI. Harrison Ford is the last great classic action star no doubt about it.    As far as Training Day, anyone pretty much could step right into that role. Yes I have seen it and still to this day wonder why anyone can see it as a great film. Ethan Hawk is a great actor? When did this happen? Not sure we watched the same film or is it the age gap?    Malcolm X,  You first need to realise and understand, was a real person. All you need to do with when portraying a real person is impersonate them. There is plenty of footage of the real person to study from. He did not create a character, he impersonated a person. Maybe its just me but there is enough drama in real life to sit down and watch someone else's drama on film. I tried watching Malcolm X and just couldnt do it, boring and just uninteresting to me personaly but o each their own.    Pretty much any actor will tell you, drama is easy, comedy is hard.",0

A lot of fans my age say that the saturation of too many new Transformers ruined Generation 1 and made it get cancelled. I don't think so. I think it was the saturation of Daniel being used too much, too many times when the parents were the focus of attention, then they did what Star Trek and Return Of The Jedi made mistakes with, they brought in too many different alien species, which has the same effect as too many humans. The attention was taken away from the Transformers.",0

"   This was a conversation we had about a month ago, and I haven't talked to her since the results were official, but I would image her opinion is still the same.  We were in a mall and this guy stopped us (i was her and a white guy that had an obama shirt on) and he asked us what basically the same question you did, and that's how you answered.  I didn't want to debate her in the mall so I didn't say anything, but I think there obviously is a cultural significance, but I don't know if its a Jackie Robinson type of accomplishment. His accomplishment was ending the ban on black players. Obama isn't breaking down a legal barrier, but it is a social barrier.  IDK, I'm more looking forward to the change he'll bring than his color though.",0

"This is a rather fun one that I always wanted to do. Even though most winners at science fairs are biology projects this one is still way cool and is a physics one.    You measure the speed of light. Here is what you need a microwave (without the automatic turn table), some chocolate or cheese, an accurate ruler (measurements in milimeters), a plate.    What you do is break up the cheese or chacolate and spread it up along the plate. Put it in the microwave and turn it on... observe it and wait for small parts of it to melt. This phenomina happens because the microwaves which are inside your microwave oven form a standing wave. This is why you have to stir food in it to cook it or have a turn table, or have you ever noticed how one bit will be real hot, and then the bite right next to it will be ice cold? The goal is to let it form a few hot spots that melt the cheese in those places. Then you want to take a ruler and measure the distance between each of the hotspots. You now know the wavelength of microwaves, it will be best to convert this length into meters (it will be like .005 meters or something like that though) . Now to figure out the speed of light    c = speed of light (electromagnetic radiation)  l = wavelength of the light  f = frequency of the light    The equation is as follows    c = l*f    You measured l, now to get f, look on the back of the microwave and look for the frequency of the waves. It will probably be in MHz or something like that (I don't remember the frequencies of microwaves off the top of my head). Mulitply l times f and you have just figured out the speed of light!",0

"Personally? I think everything is based on personal merit.  I've come up against several men of power in my life who are inherently sexist, but I have never failed to get what I wanted because I never let them regard me in a lower way. I think if you have enough respect for yourself and a general air of confidence, you can get most things done.  This is probably because I grew up training horses with guys though. You can whine, bitch, and moan.  I think women are definitely at a disadvantage because there is a high percentage who rely on being cute to get their way... which can work to an extent, but not in a way which will earn you any kind of respect in the future. More likely a pat on the head and a send her on her way.",0

I never had any illusions about him. I thought that at best, he'd have a 10-4 or 12-6 record at 38. Slice has never even had an amateur career and he's going up against guys who've been doing it their entire lives. he was SUPPOSED to be fighting tomato cans. everybody demanded that he fight stiffer competition to justify the personna that Elite XC manufactured or magnified for him. i wasn't a supporter because I bought into that hype. the fight world and entertainment in general has always been plagued by that kind of hypocrisy. good fiction outsells reality in every genre.",0

Especially when the UN says, ""No, you can't invade iraq"", and the US says ""Too bad, what are you going to do?"" Sicne that IS basically how it went down.  The US government does what it wants, regardless of what the UN wants. The US only ""abides"" by the UN when it's convenient for them. It's a big fucking joke. So don't try and back the US and opinion with the collaborative effors of the UN - because then you just end up looking like a complete jackass.",0

"  I will admit I would love to see a KOTOR movie but it will not happen until George Lucas sells his rights. I will also go on to admit that Epsidoe 1 n 2 were not so impressive and thankfully Epsiode 3 was THE best in the prequels. The fact Episode 3 took a darker turn was THE best choice for the final installment. Also it isn't George Lycas' fault he cannot direct anymore. Before agreeing to Write/direct Episode 1,2 and 3, George Lucas hasn't directed since Episode 4 which was released in 1977.  After Epsidoe 4 he just produced the Indiana Jones Trilogy and along with Star Wars Episode 5 and 6. It was a shame that Episode 1 n 2 weren't that good but at least they were decent. I still have yet to see The Clone Wars show so there is no telling if George Lucas gotten worse or a tad bit better.  Anyhow I personally think a Force Unleashed film would work if handled right",0

" Another reason they go through it is to weed out weaklings. Steal-your assertion that ""anyone who swims or surfs alot can easily beat this"" is completely ridiculous. Do you really think this is where the interrogation stops if no information is obtained? They go straight from waterboarding to beatings and electric shocks. The difference with this video, and the training of our military personnel, is that the training eventually stops. The torture to extract information does not.  I'd really like to see any of the dumbasses in here who support this go through it just once. They'd admit to having sex with their own mother or father to make it stop. ESPECIALLY if they didn't know what was coming next. Could be freedom, could be jumper cables attached to their testicles. They'd say anything to get the first, and they'd say anything to prevent the second. That's why torture has been proven time and time again to not get the real information you need. Gaining a prisoner's trust and extracting information through more subversive measures is far more likely to get the desired results.",0

"Yes, despite all the aid the US gives out, which - by the way - is done on purpose as a bureacratic tool to get them to rely on us, they don't like us - and they want us out.  Popular world vote does NOT like the US policing the world, and despite how they act when we give them aid etc, it makes them rely on us, and in reality makes them despise us more. It's all about the pecking order, and the side effects of reliance - as opposed to independents. This also gets ""misconstrued"" as a forced feeling of inferiority, which is also unliked.  This is the general world opinion of the US.  Lets get the hell out, it will benefit everyone involved in the long run.",0

"Since fuel costs about twice as much in Europe as in the U.S., since oil has a world-wide price and the cost of refining is about the same everywhere, the difference is taxes.

"Palin drags down Republican ticket By DAVID LIGHTMAN SarahPalin has become a drag on the Republican presidential ticket, thefirst time in recent political history that a running mate has madesuch a difference. Among many independents and moderate Republicans,she's raised serious questions about John McCain's judgment, become toomuch of a national punch line and reinforced concerns about McCain'sage. ""Nice lady, no experience. It's so sad. She's a giganticdrag,"" said Chris DePino, a Republican consultant based in New Haven,Conn. The Alaska governor does help the ticket somewhat byenergizing hard-core Republicans, but polls suggest that overall ""she'shurting John McCain,"" said Andrew Kohut, the president of the PewResearch Center. In a nationwide survey Oct. 16-19, Pew foundthat 49 percent of respondents had unfavorable views of Palin, while 44percent saw her favorably. A month earlier, 54 percent had seen herfavorably and 32 percent viewed her negatively. Typically,post-election polls find that vice-presidential choices sway about 1percent of voters. This time, Kohut said, ""we'll get a much biggernumber."" A key reason is that ""the Palin choice reflects poorlyon Senator McCain's judgment,"" said vice presidential expert JoelGoldstein, a professor of law at St. Louis University. Pew foundthat 41 percent of respondents thought McCain showed ""poor judgment""overall, while 29 percent said that of Democratic nominee Barack Obama.While McCain's number isn't solely because of his choice of Palin, herselection was a factor. McCain's age is also a reason for voters'concern about Palin. The Arizona senator is 72 and has had fourinstances of melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. MayoClinic physicians have posted a detailed explanation of McCain'scondition and treatment on his Web site. The prognosis, they said, was""good."" Worries linger, however. ""If something happened toMcCain, she would not be qualified to step in and be president,"" saidAnnette Barron, an independent voter from Altamonte Springs, Fla. Palinalso has hurt herself by becoming largely invisible to the generalpublic, except when she got media attention for starting controversies- such as charging that Obama was ""palling around with terrorists"" - orfor receiving $150,000 in clothing and accessories from the RepublicanParty. She also unabashedly identifies herself with the party's conservative wing, alienating moderates. ""Itreinforced the notion that John McCain cared little about people likeme,"" said former Maine state Rep. Sherry Huber, a Republican who backedMcCain in the primary but now supports Obama. ""She clearly does notshare the values I and other moderate Republicans do."" ProminentRepublicans have echoed that idea. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one ofMcCain's closest friends, suggested that Sen. Joseph Lieberman, anindependent Democrat from Connecticut, would have brought independentsto the ticket. Last week, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge said thathad McCain picked him, the Republican Party would have had a bettershot at winning his state. Then there's Palin's image problembecause of what vice-presidential expert Timothy Walch called ""thealbatross of American comedy."" ""Every time (comedian) Tina Feyappeared on TV imitating her, it diminished Palin,"" said Walch, thedirector of the Herbert Hoover presidential library. ""For somebodyessentially unknown, she's diminished when she becomes a caricature ofherself."" In most election years, Palin would have been afootnote, like controversial vice-presidential choices Spiro Agnew in1968 or Dan Quayle 20 years later. Both were lightly regarded buttriumphed on winning tickets. However, Goldstein, of St. LouisUniversity, noted that in 1968, Richard Nixon was 55, so the prospectof an Agnew presidency seemed dim. In 1988, Quayle ran with George H.W.Bush, who was essentially running for President Reagan's third termagainst unpopular Democrat Michael Dukakis. In 2008, Goldsteinsaid, Obama ""has convinced a broad cross-section of the American peoplehe's presidential,"" so Palin gives swing voters who are warming to theIllinois senator one more reason to move away from McCain. As forPalin's expected appeal to women, Sieglinde Warren, a teachingsupervisor from Poland, Ohio, was a Clinton supporter who now backsObama. Palin and Clinton don't compare, she said, because ""Clinton hadsome substance I could relate to."" (EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM) Tobe sure, Palin has had some positive impact on the campaign. McCain hadnever been a favorite of strict conservatives, as he challengedRepublican orthodoxy over the years on tax cuts, campaign finance,climate change and other topics. The Republican base loves Palin. ""Somany people can relate to her. She really appeals to everydayhousewives, people who go out and hunt, and people who have done greatthings in their life,"" said Bob Dodge, a retired communicationsengineer in Sarasota, Fla. And don't tell Jennifer Tarman, aBradenton, Fla., medical assistant, that Palin, who's been a governorsince December 2006, isn't qualified. ""She's more qualified thanObama,"" she said. Obama's been a U.S. senator since January 2005, buthas spent most of the past two years campaigning for the White House. Still, the experts and a lot of swing voters agree with Goldstein. ""She's made it much more difficult for McCain,"" he said. ON THE WEB John McCain's medical records: http://www.johnmccain.com/mccainrecords/",0

We are teaching our children that if someone asks to search them they need to ask for us.Â  We are their parents, We will be present for anything the school thinks they have a right to do.Â  And if they don't have a warrant then they better get one.Â  Just because my child is enrolled in school does not mean we as a family give up our rights.Â Â  I wonder if this is why people choose to home school?Â   From what I read in th OP, that an envelope disappeared.Â  Since they had no clue what happened to it they decided to search all of the children.Â  That is wrong.Â  And once again where were the parents.",0

"  In general, ÃÂ I completely disagree. ÃÂ Yes, there are those who are new and doing it for the experience, and there are those who are doing it because they have to and really donÃ¢â¬â¢t care because they are getting far less for representing someone under the Public Defenders arrangement that they would from a paying customer.ÃÂ  But there are also those who are doing it because they have a desire to see that everyone is defended. ÃÂ  I was on a murder jury where the defendant was defended by the Public Defenders office.ÃÂ  These guys threw their hearts and souls into the defense.ÃÂ  Too bad the guy was guilty as hell, but they mounted several appeals after the conviction, interviewed every member of the jury that would talk to them, and I understand that they are still trying to get this dude out.ÃÂ  I contrast that to a lawyer I had, gave him a large retainer, and he withdrew from the case after he had spent it all, much more, and I asked him to put me on a payment plan.",0

"Now mexico wants to control our laws? Either mexico should keep their people on their side or their leaders should be assassinated! Damn, I hate that country!   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico - Mexico is protesting the execution of one of its citizens in Texas despite a world court ruling for a new hearing, expressing concern for the rights of other Mexicans detained in the United States.  Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said it sent a note of protest to the State Department about Jose Medellin's case, which drew international attention because of allegations that Medellin wasn't allowed to consult the Mexican consulate for legal help following his arrest.  Texas executed Medellin, 33, late Tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in Houston.  Medellin was convicted of participating in the gang rape, beating and strangling of Elizabeth Pena, 16, and Jennifer Ertman, 14. Prosecutors said he and five fellow gang members attacked the girls as they were walking home on a June night, raped and tortured them for an hour, then kicked and stomped them before using a belt and shoelaces to strangle them.  ""I'm sorry my actions caused you pain. I hope this brings you the closure that you seek. Never harbor hate,"" Medellin said to those gathered to watch him die. ""Never harbor hate.""  In Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, where Medellin was born, a small group of his relatives condemned the execution.  ""This is another murder because no one has the right to take someone else's life, only God,"" said Medellin's cousin Reyna Armendariz.  A large black bow and a banner that read ""No to the death penalty ... may God forgive you,"" hung from an iron fence in the front of the house where Medellin lived before moving to the United States at the age of 3.  Armendariz said the family hopes Medellin's body would be return to Mexico.  ""He signed a paper saying he wanted his remains to go to a friend. Who knows if they will bring him here,"" Armendariz said sobbing.  The Mexican government statement said officials ""were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.""  An international court ruled in 2004 that the convictions of Medellin and 50 other Mexicans on death row around the United States violated the Vienna Convention, which calls for people arrested abroad to have access to their home country's consular officials.  Texas state officials say Medellin didn't ask to do so until well after he was convicted of capital murder.  The International Court of Justice, also known as the world court, said the Mexican prisoners should have new court hearings to determine whether the violation affected their cases.  President Bush asked states to review the cases, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this year neither the president nor the international court can force Texas to wait.",0

"A 70-year-old Israeli woman in the southern village of Yesha has been killed by a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, Israeli officials have said.  The rocket scored a direct hit on her house in the small farming community.  She is the second Israeli civilian to be killed by rocket or mortar fire from Gaza in less than a week.  The latest death comes as Egypt is trying to mediate a truce between Israel and Hamas, the militant Palestinian group which controls Gaza.  The head of Egyptian intelligence, Omar Suleiman, has been in Israel for talks with political leaders.  Last month the plans were given the backing of a dozen Palestinian factions including, Hamas - which has controlled Gaza since last year - and the Fatah movement of President Mahmoud Abbas.  Israel said any truce agreement must include the release of a captured Israeli soldier and an end to arms smuggling into Gaza.  The Israeli military launches frequent air strikes or incursions into Gaza in an attempt to stop the frequent rocket fire from the territory into southern Israel.  Mortar fire from Gaza killed an Israeli man on Friday in the kibbutz of Kfar Aza. Three people were wounded.  Israeli air strikes then killed five members of Hamas.  The Gaza Strip has been controlled by Hamas since last June when they ousted their rivals from the Fatah movement.   Story from BBC NEWS:",0

"   Take a world economics class, then delve into the finer points of the Defense Budget. For example, the U.S. doesn't own any of the land in the countries it has forces stationed (peacefully or otherwise). The land is rented. In Germany money is paid to the German Government every time a military vehicle is driving off of the installation. The German Government is paid a fee every time a hole is dug on the military installation itself, too. Same thing with the use of the rifle range. Let's not even get into the millions of dollars spent every year by the troops themselves within the country (the alcohol purchase alone would fund a couple of social programs here in the U.S.).  When we first set up the airbase in Hungary in support of the Operation Joint Endeavor in 1995 we almost tripled two-thirds of the country's Gross National Product.  South Korea actually only pays about 20% of their defense budget; we handle the rest in accordance of their treaty. If we were to just up and leave, they'd have to make up that last 80% in the face of North Korea's ""million man army.""  Need more examples?",0

Basically the percentage of woman who ""play nice"" is higher than the percentage of men who do. Also they focus on education more than men. (the education system actually tends to hold people back in life --- it's hard to prove due to the fact that the corporations think otherwise, without corp./gov. backing it would be obvious though.)",0

The rights of citizens will be placed in the hands to those whom it originally belonged, the American. That justice for all walks of life will be sought, even for those who most do not agree with, the homosexual, the atheist, the Muslim, the Black, the Hispanic, and all other forms of minority justice will prevail under the harsh punitive injustices of the Christian White majority. That the poor elderly will no longer suffer under the unfulfillable greed of insurance or hospital HMO's. That the dream of Americanism has now been given to those willing to work for it, and not in the hands of the Fortune 500 executives. Prosperity, growth, and equality have been returned to the great justice that is the USA.  No more religious oppression, no more religious division, no more governmental failures of misunderstanding. Tonight, America has joined together and spoke with one monstrous roar, that equality doesn't just stop at law. Shed America has of it's racial shell, it's religious shell, and regrets of mistakes of slavery long past.",0

I remember seeing an interview withMiller saying that he didn't direct a shot, but was there for advice for a lot of the filming, so Rodriguez insisted that he take a co-director credit.

In your post and the other with a list. I'd throw in Once Upon a Time in Mexico, but mainly only for Depp's performance.",0

"  agreed. I enlisted knowing full well that I may be called upon to do things i didnt want to do.  That i may have to go into combat and be killed.  My son currently is srving. He enlisted with the same foreknowledge.  There is no draft. enlistment is NOT mandatory. If you dont want to uphold the oath you must take to enlist, DONT ENLIST. No one forced them to enter the service.  To most people who are clueless about war, there is NO children. There is NO Women.  When compassion enters into it, you DIE. you team members DIE.  You are no less dead from being shot by a 10 year old then you are from anyone else. WE learned that lesson well in vietnam. 5 year olds walk into a group of GI's and detonate a grenade becuase the ""enemy"" taught them to.  I woudl have to disagree with some of the IRAQ ""vets"" howver who claim you are tuaght to kill everything if you recieve fire. This is catergorically incorrect. just as law enforcement are taught to identify threats so are soldiers taught to do the same. You aim a weapon at me, I kill you . you are a woman walking by someone with a weapon shooting at me I DONT shoot her. some people are idiots.",0

"  Well George Lucas swore that there would NEVER be an Epsiode 7,8 and 9 and concidering that Mark Hamill is old now just leaves out the possibility right there as well. Reason I think The Force Unleashed would work is because the story is right there. The story is actually in between the Episodes and is explained well on what happened to the Jedi and who finished them off.  I beaten the game and do believe that alot of the segments would work well in the movie. The part where the secret apprentice takes down a Star Destroyer with his force powers would deffinitally work well in the film as so would his fights against the Jedi he was tasked to kill. Also the ending sequence would most certainly make the film as well if it does happen.  I still have yet to see The Clone Wars movie and TV show and am awaiting the live action Bounty Hunter series due in 2011 but if there is any TRUE Star Wars film to be made it would have to be The Force Unleashed in my own opinion.",0

"Believe me, guys, I'm very much a ""take care of our own first"" kinda guy. I firmly believe we should withdraw all forces from overseas, peaceful or otherwise. I don't see the need for 14 active Aircraft Carriers plus escorts, either. I also hate the fact that so much of our own economy is tied up in the world market, as well as the fact that we pay out billions in foreign aid when we've got people starving in the streets.  I'm a staunch isolationist; always have been.  However, what I like and don't like doesn't change the facts. I'm willing to make the sacrifices necessary to withdraw into our shells and take care of ourselves first, but I can't make that choice for the rest of the country (which is why I will never run for office). What's good for me isn't always good for everyone else.",0

Men Behind the Sun To be honest, this film could be 100% fictional and it still would have made the top 10 list, as some of the scenes are downright brutal and extremely controversial: a (supposedly real) live cat is thrown into a room of starving rats and torn to pieces; a (supposedly real) corpse of a boy is slowly autopsied; a man is placed in a pressure chamber until his intestines blow out of his anus; a woman is tied to a post outside in the freezing cold, with buckets of cold water being dumped over her head to test the effects of frostbite, then her hands are plunged into boiling hot water, the skin peeling right off the bones; etc etc  3.Guinea Pig: Flower of Flesh and Blood The film itself is fairly simple: a creepy Japanese dude in a samurai suit (donât ask us) kidnaps a girl, drugs her, ties her to a bed, and slowly cuts her to pieces. Thatâs it, thatâs the whole movie. But the special effects are SO well done and so convincing, it really takes it to a whole other level. Fingers, hands, you name it; everything is cut off in slow, agonizing detail. The blood looks great, the gore is splendid, and the dismemberments are top notch (for example, after cutting off one of her hands, the fingers suddenly clench around his wrist, despite the fact it is no longer attached. Yikes.). 4. Cutting Moments Cutting Moments is a disquieting, harrowing look at the mental breakdown and subsequent downward spiral of a family torn apart by abuse, both physical and mental, and the limits of the human psyche. A mostly silent and slow-paced film, thereâs no denying the talent behind Cutting Moments, as Buck masterfully lets silence speak louder then words; allowing the tension of the film to slowly rise to a boil before the incredibly disturbing and permanently scarring bloody climax.  5. Aftermath Aftermath pushes the boundaries of the genre in ways few films even dream of. Nacho Cerda made the film as part of a trilogy, focusing on death, post-death, and rebirth. Aftermath (the 2nd film in the trilogy) shows how we are all at the mercy of others once we die; our bodies nothing more then husks of meat to be poked, prodded, and disassembled.

"Just finished watching it. Ok, I was wrong, Last House on the Left does not feature the most vile rape scene ever put on film. Whoa. But hey, at least the victim is not stabbed to death then disemboweled or forced to pee on herself. The I Spit rapists are real humanitarians. The movie itself was not as bad as I remembered it. In fact, while I guess it's really impossible to say you liked or enjoyed a film like this, I must say this is a decent film. The acting was good, and the story was ok. The DVD edition I rented cleaned up the picture beautifully. There's no way I saw a version as pristine as this when I saw it at the drive-in or on vhs 20+ years ago. All the dvd extras were great. Original reviews were available including two I remember very well, from Siskel(RIP) and my man Ebert, that caused it to be removed from the old United Theater here in Chicago. The director of the film gives an interesting commentary and tells about an actual event in his own life that he says inspired him to tell the story. I'd actually have to go against the guys and give this film a marginal thumbs up. The dvd as a package is very good and kudos to the director for not doing a musical score.",0

"Ok one Force Unleashed wouldn't work...  Why because Dath Vader is best left where he is and also where the fuck would this new apprentice fit into the whole saga without being mentioned in Episode 4 - 6. Because remember that Force Unleashed is set during the time span of 3 - 4. What happen inbetween that big gap in the saga. Its best left as a game and nothing more. And come on can they really find anyone else to do Darth Vader.   KOTOR has acctually been in discussion and George Lucas apparently expressed interested in the project as a motion picture film in 2 films, after he completed Episode III. But Lucas then decided to cancel and wipe away the idea and revealed that the ideas he had written and expressed down that would have appeared in the two KOTOR movies, will now appear some where in the anticipated Live Action Star Wars Series, which may never come, since its been in pre-production God knows how long",0

" Ehud:  We may have elected Bush twice but at least we didn't elect Gore (whom I voted for and am glad that he lost) or Kerry (who wanted Carter and Baker to be in charge of middle-east policy).  And Olmert has what, a 3% approval rating and you can't get rid of him? He is the architect of the disaster in Lebanon, the failure to take adequate steps against the Kassams, and a whole lot of bribery.  At least Bush's ratings are higher than congresses.  Both the Republcians and Democrats suck at energy policy..ÃÂ  Since the first oil embargo in 1973, America has done NOTHING about alternate (i.e. nuclear) energy.ÃÂ  I think they have been bribed by the Saudis (who paid for clinton's and Carter's libraries and hired James Baker III as a lobbyist).",0

"  The problem with using popular voting as a definitive method of making decisions about representatives. . .is that the popular vote is VERY easy to f*ck with. Given the motivation, it's really simple for someone to submit dozens of ballots using a falsified identity with each one. Since it's effectively illegal to make people provide identification when voting(and I agree with this, btw), it's makes for very skewed elections. Of course, that might not happen every time. . .but why take the risk?  I'm not saying that I agree with the Electoral College, either, since it has its own flaws. A new system should be created that does a better job at giving people a say in their government, and in the selection of representatives.",0

"  Well James Earl Jones is still alive and could do the vocal work for Darth Vader. In the past films other people filled in for the suit and James Earl Jones just did the voice over work on the character. I think the story could work for many reasons. One reason is that George Lucas produced and okayed the story for the game so if there is actually a movie he would okay the movie script since he was involved closely with the game.  Also the film could fit in really well into the saga. The reason the secret apprentice wasn't mentioned in Episode 4-6 is because he was a ""secret"" apprentice. Noone was allowd to know of his existence which makes logical sense as well. I think the film could work and possibly go into production in the coming years. The Episodes may be done but doesn't mean there can't be side story films to be made.  As for the TV series. George Lucas and his producer Rick Maccallum said recently that the 2 are sitting down with TV writers to get the much anticipated Star Wars live action show underway. So far what is said about the TV show is it won't have Jedi or even Darth Vader in it and would more or less focus on Bounty Hunters like bobba Fett. I am pretty hyped for the show but it isn't due til 2011",0

" White House: North Korea Assisted Syria On Nuclear Reactor Destroyed By Israel   White House: Syria Must 'Come Clean' About Nukes (2:27 min.)  Web Extra: U.S. Intel Video Cites N.K., Syria Link (11:50 min.)  Bush Administration Opens Up About Israeli Airstrike On Syrian Reactor WASHINGTON (CBS News) â The White House said Thursday that North Korea's secret work on anuclear reactor with Syria was ""a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the world,"" raising doubts aboutPyongyang's intention to carry through with a promised disclosure ofits nuclear activities.  Sevenmonths after Israel bombed the reactor, the White House broke itssilence and said North Korea assisted Syria's secret nuclear programand that the destroyed facility was not intended for ""peacefulpurposes.""  The disclosure could undermine six-party negotiationsto try to resolve the nuclear standoff with North Korea. The WhiteHouse issued a two-page statement after lawmakers were given detailsabout the reactor in a series of briefings on Capitol Hill. The WhiteHouse said the International Atomic Energy Agency also was beingbriefed on the intelligence.  While calling North Korea's nuclearassistance to Syria a ""dangerous manifestation"" of Pyongyang's nuclearweapons program and its proliferation activities, the U.S. said itremained committed to the talks.  The administration said that after the reactor was damaged beyond repair, Syria tried to bury evidence of its existence.  ""Thiscover-up only served to reinforce our confidence that this reactor wasnot intended for peaceful activities,"" White House press secretary DanaPerino said. ""The Syrian regime must come clean before the worldregarding its illicit nuclear activities.""  CIA Director MichaelHayden, Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell and NationalSecurity Adviser Stephen Hadley briefed lawmakers, who were shown avideo presentation of intelligence information that the administrationcontends establishes a strong link between North Korea's nuclearprogram and the bombed Syrian site. It included still photographs thatshowed a strong resemblance between specific features of the plant andthe one near Yongbyon.  According to officials familiar with thepresentation, it did not show moving images inside the facility or anyNorth Korean workers, but included photographs that depict similaritiesbetween the North Korean and Syrian reactor designs.  U.S.negotiators have been trying hard to close a deal in which North Koreawould admit to and give up all its nuclear activities in return forbeing taken off the list of countries that support terrorism, reportsCBS News national security correspondent David Martin.  But atthe same time, the administration had all the photos showing NorthKorea was secretly helping Syria build a reactor that could produceplutonium for nuclear weapons, adds Martin. The images include a photothat U.S. intelligence says shows the head of Syria's nuclear agencywith one of the North Koreans who was negotiating with the UnitedStates.  By making the photos public, Martin reports, the U.S. istelling North Korea: ""If you won't come clean, we'll come clean foryou.""  The Syrian nuclear reactor destroyed by Israeli jets waswithin weeks or months of being functional, a top U.S. official toldThe Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because of thesensitivity of the matter. The official said the facility was mostlycompleted but still needed significant testing before it could bedeclared operational.  No uranium, which is needed to fuel areactor, was evident at the site, a remote area of eastern Syria alongthe Euphrates River. But the U.S. official said the reactor was similarin design to a North Korean reactor at Yongbyon, which has in the pastproduced small amounts of plutonium, the marterial needed to makepowerful nuclear weapons.  Top members of the House IntelligenceCommittee said the reactor posed a serious threat of spreadingdangerous nuclear materials.  ""This is a serious proliferationissue, both for the Middle East and the countries that may be involvedin Asia,"" said Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich.  Hoekstra andIntelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, toldreporters after the closed meeting that they were angry that the Bushadministration had delayed briefing the full committee for eight months.  ""It'sbad management and terrible public policy to go for eight monthsknowing this was out there and then drop this in our laps six hoursbefore they go to the public,"" Hoekstra said.  President Bush'sfailure to keep Congress informed has created friction that may imperilcongressional support for Bush's policies toward North Korea and Syria,he said.  ""It totally breaks down any trust that you have betweenthe administration and Congress,"" Hoekstra said. ""I think it reallyjeopardizes any type of the agreement they may come up with"" regardingNorth Korea.  A senior administration said the White House wentpublc with the evidence now to prevent an even broader confrontation inthe Middle East region, reports CBS News White House correspondent MarkKnoller.  ""We feared that if knowledge of this event spread quickly Syria might feel greater pressure to react,"" the official said.  The White House also stressed that North Korea's assistance on the Syrian reactor was an issue of ""great international concern.""  ""Theconstruction of this reactor was a dangerous and potentiallydestabilizing development for the region and the world,"" Perino said inthe statement. ""This is particularly true because it was done covertlyand in violation of the very procedures designed to reassure the worldof the peaceful intent of nuclear activities.  ""The United Statescalls upon the international community to redouble our common effortsto ending these activities and preventing the spread of weapons of massdestruction in this critical region.""",0

"  Ugh, it's disgusting how far to the left this damned state is. You get taxed for spitting into the wind. This is why we call it ""Taxachusetts"". It's sooooo goddamned expensive to live here. I think there are so many lefties here because the vast majority of them are seriouslyÂ fiscally ignorant.  There has been SOME progress, though... literally within the last month they FINALLY enabled a free market system for car insurance. Before the whole system was absolutely HORRENDOUS. No lie, after Geico, Progressive, Allstate etc were allowed in, and government-regulated price fixing was abolished... I switched to Progressive and am saving (no lie) 1300 bucks a year.  Then again, Romney (a SUPPOSED conservative - BS if you ask me), uses leftist policies like FORCING everyone to get health insurance, otherwise you have to pay 200-900 dollars in additional state taxes when tax time comes around. He makes me sick. I always have health insurance, but that policy I find especially disgusting.",0

"  Didn't know much about hemp, so I looked it up. Seems like we should allow it here!  Hemp (from Old English hÃ¦nep, see cannabis (etymology)) is the common name for plants of the entire family of Cannabis, although the term is often used to refer only to Cannabis strains cultivated for industrial (non-drug) use. Hemp is cultivated virtually everywhere in the world except for the United States, and its cultivation in western countries is growing steadily. For example, Canadian Hempseed exports surged 300% last year[citation needed]. China, and other eastern countries, never prohibited its cultivation and use it extensively.  Industrial hemp has thousands of potential uses, from paper to textiles to biodegradable plastics to health food to fuel but it has not been the great commercial success that the enthusiast hoped for in countries where it is legal to harvest. It is one of the fastest growing biomasses on the planet, and one of the earliest domesticated plants known. It also runs parallel with the ""Green Future"" objectives that are becoming increasingly popular. Hemp requires little to no pesticides, replenishes soil with nutrients and nitrogen, controls erosion of the topsoil, and produces lots of oxygen, considering how fast it grows. Furthermore, Hemp could be used to replace many potentially harmful products, such as tree paper (the process of which uses bleaches and other toxic chemicals, apart from contributing to deforestation), cosmetics (which often contain synthetic oils that can clog pores and provide little nutritional content for the skin), plastics (which are petroleum based and cannot decompose), and more.",0

"  There are exceptions to the 4th Amendment in relation to public schools. Read this:  Public Schools .--In New Jersey v. T.L.O.,  108 the Court set forth the principles governing searches by public school authorities. The Fourth Amendment applies to searches conducted by public school officials because ''school officials act as representatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents.''  109 However, ''the school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject.''  110 Neither the warrant requirement nor the probable cause standard is appropriate, the Court ruled. Instead, a simple reasonableness standard governs all searches of students' persons and effects by school authorities.  111 A search must be reasonable at its inception, i.e., there must be ''reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.''  112 School searches must also be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances justifying the interference, and ''not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.''  113 In applying these rules, the Court upheld as reasonable the search of a student's purse to determine whether the student, accused of violating a school rule by smoking in the lavatory, possessed cigarettes. The search for cigarettes uncovered evidence of drug activity held admissible in a prosecution under the juvenile laws.     Click here for source",0

"Obviously, you have no idea how the mortgage markets worked. What benefit would it be for Joe Lender to hold on to a loan he knows will go bad? Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac acting as intermediaries between the lenders and the overall secondary mortgage market facilitated this entire situation.  The article itself says that 24% of Fannie and Freddie's assets were subprime. Percents are ratios. 84% of the total sub prime loans made is not calculated from the same total number that 24% was derived from.  Do you need proof that Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages and sell them on the secondary market?  Here from Fannie Mae's website, ""Fannie Mae operates in the U.S. secondary mortgage market. Rather than making home loans directly with consumers, we work with mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners to help ensure they have funds to lend to home buyers at affordable rates. We fund our mortgage investments primarily by issuing debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets.""  I can't find an actual figure stating how much of these private sector loans were actually sold to Fannie and Freddie. However, citing that Fannie doesn't make direct home loans to consumers they had to buy their sub prime holdings from somewhere. My guess is the private sector since thats where the mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners reside.",0

" An Admiral Takes on the White House By Gareth Porter Go to Original Washington - A new article on CENTCOM commander Adm. William Fallonconfirms that his public statements last fall ruling out war againstIran last fall were not coordinated with the White House and landed himin trouble more than once with President George W. Bush and VicePresident Dick Cheney. In anadmiring article on Fallon in Esquire, former Pentagon official ThomasP.M. Barnett writes that Fallon angered the White House by ""brazenlychallenging"" Bush on his aggressive threat of war against Tehran.Barnett also cites ""well-placed observers"" as saying Bush may soonreplace Fallon with a ""more pliable"" commander. Barnett's account, which quotes conversations with Fallon during theCENTCOM commander's trips to the Middle East, shows that Fallonprivately justified his statements contradicting the Bush policy ofkeeping the ""option"" of an unprovoked attack on Iran ""on the table"" asnecessary to calm the fears of Egypt and other friendly Arab regimes ofa US-Iran war. Barnett recalls thatwhen Fallon was in Cairo in November, the lead story in that day'sedition of the English-language daily Egyptian Gazette carried theheadline ""US Rules Out Strike against Iran"" over a picture of Fallonmeeting with President Hosni Mubarak. That story, published Nov. 19 and not picked up by any US news media,reported that Fallon had ""ruled out a possible strike against Iran andsaid Washington was mulling nonmilitary options instead."" Later that day, according to Barnett, Fallon told him during a coffeebreak in a military meeting, ""I'm in hot water again,"" and thenconfirmed that his problems were directly with the White House. That was the second time in less than a week and the third time inseven weeks that Fallon had publicly declared that there would be nowar against Iran. In an interview with Al-Jazeera television inSeptember, which Fallon himself had requested, according to a source atAl-Jazeera, he had said, ""This constant drum beat of conflict is whatstrikes me which is not helpful and not useful."" And only a week before the trip to Egypt, in an interview withFinancial Times, Fallon had said, a military strike was not ""in theoffing,"" adding, ""Another war is just not where we want to go."" These statements represented an extraordinary exercise of power by acombat commander, because it contradicted a central feature of theBush-Cheney strategy on Iran. High-ranking Bush administrationofficials had been routinely repeating the administration's line thatno option had been taken ""off the table"" since early 2005. At an Oct. 17 news conference, Bush said he had ""told people that ifyou're interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought tobe interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary tomake a nuclear weapon."" Fallon'spublic statements explicitly ruling out an attack on Iran thusundermined the Bush administration's threat against Iran. The willingness of the top commander in the Middle East to take themilitary option ""off the table"" was in part a reflection of thedetermination of uniformed military leaders to prevent what theyregarded as a disastrous course. Thenew chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, whoreplaced Gen. Peter Pace in June, was even more candid about hisopposition to the use of force against Iran than Pace had been,according to a Congressional staffer who had participated in privatemeetings with both. Pace declared publicly in late October, ""We have tobe mindful of the risks that would [be spawned] by engaging in a thirdconflict"" in the region. Mullen added, however, that military options ""cannot be taken off the table."" But Fallon, as the commander responsible for the entire Middle East,was concerned about more than the consequences of actually exercisingthe military option. He was prompted to enunciate a ""no-war"" line onIran by the panicky reactions of Arab states to what they thought wereindications of the warlike intentions of Bush administration. In the latter half of 2007 friendly Arab regimes were upset by thepossibility of a US-Iran war, which they feared would destabilize theentire region. Fallon is quoted as telling Barnett, ""[I]t's all anyonewants to talk about right now. People here hear what I'm saying andunderstand. I don't want to get them too spun up."" Fallon told Barnett that his ruling out of military action against Iranwas necessary to calm the very regimes the Bush administration washoping to enlist to support its anti-Iran line. ""Washington interpretsthis as all aimed at them,"" Fallon said in Cairo, according to Barnett.""Instead, it's aimed at governments and media in this region. I'm nottalking about the White House."" Fallon was arguing, in effect, that it makes no sense to make thepossibility of an unprovoked attack part of your declaratory policy ifmerely induces confusion and panic among friendly governments withoutinfluencing the target of the threat. Barnett quotes Fallon as complaining that ""they"" - meaning White Houseofficials - were asking him, ""Why are you even meeting with Mubarak?""But Fallon strongly defended the diplomatic role he was playing inrelations with Mubarak and other Middle Eastern leaders. ""This is mycenter of gravity,"" Fallon told him. ""This is my job."" Fallon's sensitivity to the political-diplomatic consequences of adeclaratory policy that explicitly keeps open the threat of anaggressive war as a potential option set him apart not only from theWhite House but from the consensus among national security specialistsin both parties. In early 2007, all three of the top three Democraticcontenders for the presidential nomination publicly declared theirsupport for keeping ""all options on the table."" Fallon is not the first CENTCOM commander to rein in aggressive WhiteHouse policy toward the Middle East. In late 1997, according to DanaPriest's book, The Mission, the Bill Clinton White House wanted CENTCOMcommander Gen. Anthony Zinni to order his pilots to provoke a militaryconfrontation with Iraq in the no-fly zone by deliberately drawing firefrom Iraqi planes. The request forsuch a provocation was conveyed to Zinni by the vice chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Ralston. But Zinni, who believed thatit could lead to an unwanted war with Iraq, insisted that a formalrequest from the White House would have to be sent, and the plan wasdropped. The unhappiness of the Bushadministration with Fallon's role as well as the unflattering pictureof administration policy revealed by the article was evident Thursdayfrom the failure of either the White House or the Pentagon to issue theusual reassuring statements in response to the article. The White House declined to comment, although, according to theWashington Post's Thomas Ricks, the article ""was being discussedthere."" The Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said Secretary ofDefense Robert M. Gates ""has read the profile on Admiral Fallon butchooses not to comment on it or other press accounts.""",0

  Hayden Christensen was likely THE worst cast for Anakin Sykwalker. I figured either George Lucas either wanted a bargain bin actor or he just couldn't find anyone else to replace him. I remembered after Episode 2 came into theaters it was rumored that Hugh Jackman was to take over the role of Anakin Sykwalker. Reason that was the rumor was because it was said at the time that Episode 3 would take place a big amount of years after Episode 2.  It was right when Episode 3 went into production that everyone around saw that the rumor was false and Hayden was back.I personally liked Episode 3 alot and did appreciate alot of the things in it. I liked the entire beginning with the battle over Coruscant took place which lead to the duel between Anakin and Count Dooku.  I also liked how the emperor held a lightsaber and did combat with Yoda and also the whole battle sequence between General Grievous and Obi Wan was surely entertaining. I liked Episode 3 and it would be entertaining to see The Force Unleashed turned into a film. if it is written well and has a good director on board I would be satisfied.  If The Force Unleashed is turned into a film I would highly doubt George Lucas would direct. He would most likely co write and probably produce. The least Star Wars brand he would direct would be some of the episodes on the upcoming live action TV show due in late 2011.,0

"Iraqi PM Gives Basra Gunmen Ultimatum Rocket Attacks Hit Green Zone  By Sholnn Freeman and Sudarsan Raghavan Washington Post Foreign Service Wednesday, March 26, 2008; 11:39 AM    BAGHDAD, March 26 -- Clashes continued Wednesday between Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias in the southern city of Basra, as Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki laid down a deadline for gunmen to surrender and fresh rocket attacks hit Baghdad's Green Zone.  The U.S. Embassy in the Iraqi capital said that three Americans were badly hurt by the latest strikes in the Green Zone, a fortified area that houses the U.S. Embassy compound and the Iraqi government, according to the Associated Press. No further details were immediately available. Mortars and rockets have struck the Green Zone and other U.S. positions repeatedly since Sunday, with U.S. officials reporting 12 strikes Tuesday.  According to wire reports, as many as 55 people have died during the past two days in intense clashes that began in Basra as part of an Iraqi government crackdown on Shiite militias in the area, particularly the Mahdi Army of hard-line cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Violence subsequently spread to Shiite areas in Baghdad and other cities.  The operation in Basra won praise Tuesday from the White House, where spokeswoman Dana Perino referred to it as a ""brave decision"" by Maliki to assert Iraqi government control over an important port city that serves as the country's gateway to the Persian Gulf.  According to wire service reports, Maliki issued a statement giving gunmen in Basra three days to give up their weapons and renounce further violence. Those who don't, said a Maliki aide, will be targeted for arrest in the ongoing security operation.  Speaking about the Basra offensive, U.S. military spokesman Maj. Gen. Kevin Bergner said, ""Initial reports are that they are making progress."" But he cautioned that it was still too early to grade the success of the operation.  ""A large part of the determination will be the citizens of Basra and how they respond,"" Bergner said at a briefing Wednesday in the Green Zone. He said Iraq has moved an additional 2,000 troops to Basra. A British military spokesman said Tuesday that Iraqi police and military troops in the area total 16,700, including national policemen, special forces and military police.  Bergner called the rocket attacks against the Green Zone ""criminal activity"" and said U.S. weapons teams had stopped eight intended rocket attacks targeting the Green Zone and located a stockpile of the weapons.  Iraqi forces were backed by U.S. and British reconnaissance planes as they launched their Basra offensive, an operation aimed at breaking the power of politically backed gunmen in the city.  The fiercest fighting took place in Basra neighborhoods where Iraqi forces targeted members of Sadr's Mahdi Army, further risking the collapse of a cease-fire that Sadr declared last summer. His fighters' stand-down has been widely credited with helping curb violence throughout the country during the U.S. troop buildup known as the surge.  When the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker deliver a report card on the country before Congress next month, a key gauge of progress will be whether the Iraqi government and its security forces are prepared to take over as U.S. troops withdraw.  The offensive in Basra, an important test of that preparedness, was several weeks in the making. Altough it targets the Mahdi Army in particular, its goal is also to break the grip that other Shiite militias, criminal gangs and death squads hold upon the southern port city, the conduit for Iraq's oil exports. In recent weeks, the militias have often battled one another in the streets.  It was unclear why U.S. forces would take part in a broad armed challenge to Sadr and his thousands-strong militia on the eve of Petraeus's assessment, which the Bush administration has said would greatly influence its decision on whether to draw down troop levels.  But many Sadr followers view the offensive as the latest attempt by the United States and Sadr's Shiite rivals, who run Iraq's government, to take advantage of Sadr's cease-fire to weaken his movement politically ahead of provincial elections that could take place this year.  ""We are really scared,"" said Aahad Hamid, 27, a Basra University employee whose voice quivered on the phone as Iraqi attack helicopters flew over the city. ""We can hear the voice of the bullets.""  In a sign of the offensive's importance, Maliki flew to Basra on Monday to oversee operations.  By Tuesday evening, Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias had also clashed in the cities of Kut and Hilla, as well as outside Sadr's Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City. Dusk-to-dawn curfews were imposed on at least six cities in southern Iraq, police said.  In addition to resisting with arms, Sadr's movement led a labor strike for a second day in many parts of eastern and central Baghdad on Tuesday, demanding the release of Sadr's jailed followers and an end to Iraqi government raids. Sadrist leaders ordered stores to close and taxi and bus drivers to stop operations. Many neighborhoods turned into virtual ghost towns, their usually busy streets all but empty. Parents kept their children home from school.  Sadr, who imposed the cease-fire to improve his nationalist credentials and rein in his often unruly militia, is under immense pressure from senior loyalists to lift the cease-fire order. Two weeks ago, he issued a statement permitting the Mahdi Army to fire on U.S. and Iraqi forces in self-defense. Hazim al-Araji, a senior Sadr official in the southern holy city of Najaf, told reporters there that the cease-fire remains in place despite Tuesday's clashes.  Later, hundreds of Sadr followers took to the streets of Najaf, carrying Korans, Iraqi flags and olive branches. Calling Maliki ""the agent of Americans,"" they chanted: ""No, no occupation! No, no terrorism!""  ""The Iraqi army went to Basra under the pretext of imposing a security plan, but the fact is they are targeting Sadrists,"" said Haidar al-Jaberi, a Sadr official who joined the protest.  Violence has gripped Basra since December, when British troops handed over control of the province to the Iraqi government. A power struggle between the Mahdi Army and its main rival, the Badr Organization militia of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, has battered the city in recent months. Smaller Shiite militias are also taking part in the fighting.  Ahead of the offensive, the Iraqi government closed off land access to the city and imposed a nighttime curfew until further notice. The government ordered schools, institutes and universities to cancel classes from Tuesday through Thursday. Some residents said they had no time to stock up on food and clean water.  Residents also reported that sporadic clashes began in Basra early Tuesday morning in the neighborhoods of Hayania, Jubaila and Jumhuria, all known Sadr strongholds. In telephone interviews, they described seeing military vehicles, soldiers and policemen exchanging fire with gunmen. Television footage showed militiamen firing rocket-propelled grenades at Iraqi security forces; others attacked from rooftops with AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns and mortars.  As of Tuesday afternoon, 13 gunmen, three Iraqi policemen and six civilians had been killed, police said. Scores more were injured, and at least five military vehicles were set ablaze, according to police.  ""No one is on the street,"" said Mohammed Kadhim, who owns a clothing shop in the city center. As he spoke, gunfire could be heard in the background. ""I am not able to go out of my house.""  Kadhim added that one of his neighbors had been shot in the face and was in critical condition.  A total of 15,000 Iraqi military and police personnel were participating in the Basra operation, according to an adviser to Iraq's security forces who spoke by telephone. At one point in the conversation, a mortar shell landed near his building, he said. He paused to take time to check on his soldiers and examine his body for shrapnel.  ""It's a tough and difficult battle,"" he said, adding that his men were fighting Mahdi Army militias, criminal gangs and death squads.  The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters, said he expected the campaign to take a week to 10 days. ""No state can have two armies. It is either the Iraqi military or the Mahdi Army,"" he said.  Col. Bill Buckner, a U.S. military spokesman, said coalition forces were providing intelligence, surveillance and support aircraft. Maj. Tom Holloway, a British military spokesman, said British forces were standing by but were not involved in the crackdown. He also said the British and Americans were providing surveillance support from aircraft.  As the offensive progressed, violence broke out elsewhere in the country. In Baghdad's al-Amin neighborhood, Mahdi Army gunmen stormed two offices of the Dawa party, which Maliki heads, and clashed with guards there. Five Mahdi Army gunmen and two Dawa guards were killed, an Interior Ministry official said.  In Sadr City on Tuesday afternoon, Mahdi Army militiamen were manning checkpoints and directing traffic. The main police station was empty.  Abu Ali al-Fartousi, a Mahdi Army fighter, said a battle broke out in Sadr City at 10:30 p.m., with Mahdi fighters using machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to repel government forces. A U.S. military spokesman reported no word on any late-night fighting in Sadr City.  Lt. Col. Steven Stover, a U.S. military spokesman, said U.S. troops backed Iraqi security forces as they engaged with ""special groups criminal elements outside of Sadr City."" A U.S. soldier was killed about 5 p.m. in an attack near Baghdad's Adhamiyah district, the U.S. military said. He was not identified.  Special correspondents Zaid Sabah, Naseer Nouri, Dalya Hassan and K.I. Ibrahim in Baghdad, Saad Sarhan in Najaf, and Washington Post staff in Nasiriyah contributed to this report.

social heathcare will fail in this country it hasnt worked anywhere else it wont work here.  i belive we need to make healthcare a little cheaper to a certain degree. we shouldnt just give it away like to do food stamps. the more u give stuff away like that the higher prices go up so you still cant get it. its like when he said if u just tax the corps. they just go up on prices what we need to do is not tax anyone more but to stop all the loop holes in the system. you can raise the tax all you want on the rich they will just find a way out of it.  oh and on you stupid comment about 250K being rich yeah like 30 years ago. my Father makes 140k alone that doesnt include all th bonouses he gets through out the year and the investments he has made and yet he is still struggling a little not alot but he odesnt have a maid or personal driver in fact he dives a 1997 dondge intrepid that needs new brakes and belts. yes he does things with my mom time to time but they work thier ass off to save money for trips. we went from being in a trailer trach area to living in a nicer town. its not 90210 but its safer and better then what we had before and its cuz he worked his ass off and still does.  Sure thier are those who do work hard that need help but thier are just as many in the lower class that dont do anything that expect the govermnt to take care of them and its bull. go watch and see people get food stamps and watch the poeple who pull up in escallades with 22's go get some. its bull so whats going to happen is now my dad and mom are going to have to pay more taxes of rthem to get more free stuff from the gov.,0

At any rate, the chances of Palin stepping into the position some time in the next 4 years is significant.

Secondly, It is best that I try to get people in office who will best represent me and the choices I make in life in addition to the lifestyle I choose to keep. I also have a huge fear that if we choose to not be the deciding factors in the candidacy for presidency, then someone else will.

"Michele Bachmann's rival reaps benefits of her 'Hardball' comments LA Times, 10/23/08  By P.J. Huffstutter  Reporting from Blaine, Minn. â Elwyn Tinklenberg is living the long-shot candidate's political dream.  There weren't enough chairs for the volunteers crammed inside the four-room campaign office Wednesday morning. Every time aides hit ""refresh"" on their computers, hundreds more online donations appeared. Downstairs, the postal carrier spent 10 minutes trying to cram a two-foot stack of envelopes stuffed with checks into the mail slot.  ""It's been raining money,"" said Beth DeZiel, 39, the campaign's dazed deputy finance director. ""There's so much, we can barely keep up. It's unbelievable.""  But this unsolicited good fortune -- $1.3 million since Friday -- isn't based on anything the Democratic former mayor and grandfather of seven did. It's all because of something his rival, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, said.  On Friday afternoon, Bachmann appeared on MSNBC's ""Hardball with Chris Matthews"" and made what has been dubbed the million-dollar mistake: Bachmann, 52, alleged that presidential candidate Barack Obama may hold ""anti-American"" views, and proposed a media investigation into ""the views of the people in Congress [to] find out: Are they pro-America or anti-America?""  While Sen. Obama's presidential bid has transformed the way campaigns use the Internet to reach volunteers and donors, the technology has also become a way for the public to instantly react -- even to races in which they can't vote.  Those quick reactions, often in the form of donations, can influence the outcome of a campaign, said Julie Barko Germany, director of the Institute for Politics, Democracy & the Internet at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.  Barko German said ""the Internet can be an amplifier,"" enabling viewers to react instantly to something that incites strong support or fury.  ""It's an excellent fundraising tool,"" she added, citing research indicating that ""when you show someone a video online, they donate 10% more.""  Bachmann's interview has turned the race into one of the country's most intensely watched. It also unleashed an online backlash against Bachmann, who many local political observers assumed would easily win reelection.  President Bush won the district in 2004 with 57% of the vote. In 2006, former state Sen. Bachmann was heralded as the first female Republican to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the district, which is dominated by blue-collar and farming communities.  And this summer, one of the few polls conducted in the race showed that Bachmann held a 13-point lead over Tinklenberg.  But on Wednesday, the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled all of its TV advertising supporting Bachmann in the 6th District, according to a GOP source. Since her ""Hardball"" appearance, Bachmann's lawn signs have been vandalized. Callers spew profanity at volunteers and obscenities about the congresswoman at her district campaign office.  Bachmann has retreated from her statements at nearly every campaign stop. She blamed the brouhaha on falling into a ""trap"" she said Matthews laid for her, and on having her words twisted by bloggers.  ""This has been a game of telephone gone into overdrive -- nothing more,"" said Bachmann spokeswoman Michelle Marston. ""A week ago, our competitor had no name identification. If they think that they'll win by throwing a million dollars worth of mud, I can tell you right now it won't be enough.""  Marston said Bachmann's campaign also had seen a jump in contributions, from sympathetic donors who feel she's being unfairly targeted. But Marston said she didn't know the specific amount.  At the time Bachmann was on ""Hardball,"" Tinklenberg was watching a college hockey game and stumping for votes in the bleachers. The cheers drowned out the sound of his cellphone ringing.  ""By the time I looked at it, my voice mail was full,"" said Tinklenberg, 58, who served as Gov. Jesse Ventura's transportation commissioner from 1999 to 2002 and now works as a transportation consultant.  ""It was family, friends, neighbors, supporters,"" Tinklenberg said. ""Everyone was asking, 'Did you see what she said?' ""  Since then, the campaign -- whose eight staff members had gone Dumpster-diving for office furniture and the wire wickets used for lawn signs -- has become flush.  The majority of the funds have come electronically. Of the more than 20,000 online donations, 3,210 came from Minnesota. An additional 2,405 people donated from California, and 2,330 from Texas.  Thousands of people have called the campaign office, offering up their credit card numbers. Some gave the maximum $2,300, but most offered far smaller amounts, $3 or $5, along with a message of support and an apology for not being able to give more.  ""I'm a registered Republican and I have never made contributions to political campaigns,"" wrote one 66-year-old donor. ""I wish I could send more."" In a greeting card with a fuzzy white kitten on the front, another donor wrote, ""What your opponent said on Chris Matthews was sickening! Hope you can defeat her!""  People who said they couldn't afford to give cash have been dropping off food for Tinklenberg and the staff -- platters of apple strudel, pots of chicken noodle soup, paper bags stuffed with oatmeal cookies.  Now, Tinklenberg said, the campaign is trying to find ways to spend so much money in so little time, so he can get out his message on ways to attract jobs, improve public infrastructure and expand public transportation options. His staff is frantically contacting local TV and radio stations to snap up available advertisement spots, installing more phone lines and placing orders for stacks of boxes of campaign literature.  ""I'm not happy she said what she said,"" Tinklenberg said. ""But we certainly are benefiting from it.""  Huffstutter is a Times staff writer.  ------------------------------------------     Here is the Anti-American Tinklenberg's website where you can give til' it hurts.   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!   If Tinklenberg wins, I will be gloating for years.",0

"This isn't even debatable anymore. The ARMED FORCES JOURNAL (the bunch of pansy, pacifist liberals that they are) argued that waterboarding = torture some time ago.  http://www.armedforcesjournal.com/2007/12/3230108  TO RUDY GIULIANI AND ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE MICHAEL MUKASEY For their tacit support of waterboarding. In an interview, Giuliani was asked for his views on using Ã¢â¬Åenhanced interrogation techniques,Ã¢â¬ including waterboarding. He responded that in a hypothetical scenario that assumed an attack, Ã¢â¬ÅI would tell the people who had to do the interrogation to use every method they can think of.Ã¢â¬ Prompted again on the specific use of waterboarding, he repeated Ã¢â¬Åevery method they could think of.Ã¢â¬ Mukasey said he found waterboarding to be Ã¢â¬Årepugnant,Ã¢â¬ but he wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t answer whether it amounted to torture.  Let AFJ be crystal clear on a subject where these men are opaque: Waterboarding is a torture technique that has its history rooted in the Spanish Inquisition. In 1947, the U.S. prosecuted a Japanese military officer for carrying out a form of waterboarding on a U.S. civilian during World War II.  Waterboarding inflicts on its victims the terror of imminent death. And as with all torture techniques, it is, therefore, an inherently flawed method for gaining reliable information. In short, it doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t work. That blunt truth means all U.S. leaders, present and future, should be clear on the issue.",0

"   Oh, from the outside looking in, you're right.  But from inside the McCain campaign ... the notion that a candidate runs with a verity that he may die due to his age and health in office isn't in the playbook. So it is McCain first, Palin second and only in a supporting role.  Palin stealing headlines from Obama is one thing but also pushing McCain off the headlines is not acceptable.  It was important to get the base back with him because his position with them hasn't always been a totally warm and fuzzy experience. Palin was the answer, it seems. The question really is, though, how big is that base today compared to previous elections?  Vocal, the base may be but how many are still in that base? I have my doubts that it is as big as it once was. It is still sizable and McCain needs them to have a prayer of chance of winning but I am a little skeptical about its current size partly because of Palin and what her stronpoints at re-activating that base happen to be.",0

To Seth: I looked up the 2000 supreme court judges and most of them were placed on the bench by republican presidents meaning that they swung towards bush. now the bench has some new people. but all in all one still must be weary of such a system. a system that can almost if given the power to do so or by themselves with the protection of the military decide who can live or die in this country by simple declarations. it is complicated. not one government or political system is perfect. i understand that.,0

To answer the question... based on the map posted in the thread it's obvious the southeast is not receiving the same percentage of taxes. I'm guessing that the southeast financially speaking is wealthier than the northern parts. It is fashionable for wealthy people to donate to charities. It is possible that whatever taxes they have less of in comparison with the other parts are compensated for by people donated to various charities such as privately funded soup kitchens and other things of that nature. Now in saying all that I said I was not implying that all public services are necessarily necessary and in writing what was just written previously in this sentence I was not saying whether or not I disagree with various public services being funded.,0

"  Well in that case we could just cut one down......even when we need one there still hated. when you think of a lawyer the first thing that always comes to mind is your going to get screwed.  Funny that your bro is a real estate attorney. In my one post about getting screwed over by the one I retained, dealed exclusivly with real estate law. The deception he used to justify his costs was unbelievable, using most of the retainer in phone calls to me ""reviewing the facts"" over and over again. That scumbag even billed me for creating a bill. By the time he actually contacted the developer most of the retainer was gone and of course he needed more money to continue.  There's some things that most decent people don't do, however seems normal for lawyers to cross that line. There in the same class as a funeral director, acting like they feel for your pain and loss, then turn around and sell you a 1,000 casket for 10 grand, of course at the same time selling you a bill of goods that how your departed would be better respected in the silk lined box with the gold plated hardware.",0

"Fallon 'may lose job over Iran war'  Adm.William Fallon, the head of the US Central Command, may lose his jobfor opposing President Bush's plans to wage war against Iran. According to a new Esquirearticle by Thomas Barnett; Admiral Fallon may be prematurely 'relievedof his command' as soon as this summer to be replaced with a more'pliable' commander.  ""If that were to happen, it maywell mean that the president and vice-president intend to take militaryaction against Iran before the end of this year and don't want acommander standing in their way,"" says the article which will bepublished on March 12.  Admiral Fallon, who has beennamed as 'one of the best strategic thinkers in uniform today' byDefense Secretary Robert Gates, opposed the troops surge in Iraq andhas consistently battled with President George W. Bush to avertconfrontation with Iran.  The Navy admiral has vowed thatan attack on Iran would 'not happen on his watch', calling the WhiteHouse warmongering echelons 'not helpful'.  Washington and its allies are at loggerheads with the Islamic Republic over the country's nuclear standoff with the West.  TheBush administration accuses Iran of pursuing nuclear weaponry, whileTehran maintains its uranium enrichment will only provide fuel for thecountry's under-construction nuclear power plants.  PresidentBush insists the military option against Iran remains on the table,while his top military experts, including Admiral Fallon, urge theWhite House to choose a diplomatic approach towards Tehran.  In a Thursday White House press briefing, spokeswoman Dana Perino was asked about the Esquire piece and refused to confirm whether Fallon's position is secure until the end of his tenure.",0

JANE FONDA'S NEW WORKOUT VIDEO!,0
"It is possible that Palin's strengths as a personality were not capitalized properly by the McCain campaign. Her expensive makeover, for example, might not have been so radically necessary if the idea were to push the hockey mom image more.  But I think there are some pretty obvious reasons why the campaign wants to control Palin rather tightly. Upon introduction of Palin, the talk was as if Obama and Palin were the ones directly contesting for office.  This obviously would be damaging to McCain so you would have to think that McCain's advisers would want to redirect the focus on the main candidate and, also, bring Palin under wing in terms of talking points ... the way that the McCain advisers see the issues to be.  Rollins refers to the problem as mishandling Palin which does not underscore whether he saw Palin as an asset for substantive issues.  Bill Kristol, an early and still vocal champion of Palin feels that she should have been let loose to just speak her mind ... within bounds, presumably.  Either way, her role was to keep the hopes of a major BOP base alive and active and she has done that.  That there are GOP opinion leaders that have moved away from the campaign to support Obama isn't simply a matter of Palin having been mishandled, imo.",0

"  K. Now here is my stance on it all. I think if 1 is legal the other has to be. Simply because they are the same thing in concept: cheap labor for an advantage in a market, less input for the same output. I'm not necessarily for both, but i do think that if Companies can go offshore, then companies who can't afford to (Despite the industry) should be able to higher cheap labor.  The problem with socialism is that government controlling wages will lead to lack of effort because of the lack of benefits. Right now, people work hard and continue to work hard to work their way up that ladder, with socialism, you don't get the same kind of purpose, or drive, from the workers. What we have now, isn't a real capitalism because no matter what, the gov't still watches for monopolies and still regulates a base point in wages (minimum wages).  I would prefer a capitalistic market over a socialistic market any day of the week because it benefits the hard working man who strives to climb the ladder.",0

"Bale's Batman voice was shit. (and that concludes the list of things not awesome about ""The Dark Knight"")  The movie is badass. Best (non indie) of the Year. (mainstream NEVER tops indie)  And now, Corrections to dumb comments made earlier by people who just didn't know any better:  1) ""The Dark Knight"" is a gift from god... Specifically to me. 2) Ledger's ""Joker"" is in fact the greatest portrayl of a (super)villain of all times. Primarily due to the fact that He played it in such a realistic way. If a super villain like ""The Joker"" did really exist, I imagine that he'd be exactly like that. Most super villains in movies don't have the level of realistic character depth, that Ledger, (along with the amazing writers) brought to the ""joker"".ÃÂ  Besides... I dare the OP to suggest who IS the greatest villain then, since ""the joker isn't"" 3)I agree that other films have been storywise on par (and better) than The Dark Knight... But what makes this one stand out is that it was done on a mainstream scale.ÃÂ  This movie is VERY noir, and dark, unhappy movies are generally not so big with the mass public.ÃÂ  Thats why we've rarely seen it done (if ever), in a guaranteed blockbuster hit like a Batman movie (or any other big name superhero movie)ÃÂ  I think with the success of ""The Dark Knight"" big budget studios may stop ""playing it safe"" and start producing more films that think outside ""hollywood box"".  -Dark Knight was awesome.ÃÂ  Very Awesome.",0

"  A bit late in the day but you're right, you will get flayed for this.  This is the argument that Kelvin McKenzie tried to use when doing a bit of Jock bashing on quesiton time.  However, the true figures that came about later showed that out of the UK Scotland was the only part that received what it gave, ie we are self sufficient, if you include the revenues from Scottish gas and oil which at present has been subsidising the rest of the UK since the 70s.  Scotland says it pays its way and does not need English taxes Â· Analysis assigns all North Sea revenues to Edinburgh Â· Spendthrift claims based on 'myths and mistakes'  James Meikle The Guardian, Saturday November 3 2007 Article history Scotland pays its own way despite its depiction as a spendthrift nation abusing the generosity of English taxpayers, according to a new analysis of government spending. And far from receiving an unfair proportion of the tax pot, the breakdown shows that Scotland gets less public spending per head than Northern Ireland or London. Tax revenues from Scotland almost match the country's Â£49.2bn a year public spending - although only if all North Sea oil and gas revenues are attributed to Edinburgh, a controversial allocation.  The research, published yesterday by the Glasgow Herald, is based on Treasury figures in Whitehall, an analysis by consultants Oxford Economics and the newspaper's own calculations.  Tired of the clamour from English politicians and the London-based media for Gordon Brown to rein in the Scottish executive's spending, the paper said much of the ""mischief"" was based on a series of myths, mistakes and misconceptions.  David Cameron has signalled that he would review the Treasury system for sharing government funds across the country, adding that people should not think ""there was some magic pot of gold"" in England. Former Sun editor Kelvin Mackenzie also attacked ""our tartan chums"" for taking the ""clever wealth-creators"" of England for granted.  Critics say that Scots receive Â£1,500 a head more than people living in England, but the new analysis suggests the truth is more complicated. Despite its pockets of deprivation - one-third of the UK's landmass and far-flung communities are in Scotland - the average Â£9,631 public spending per head is less than London's Â£9,748 or Northern Ireland's Â£10,271. While cities such as Glasgow receive high levels of incapacity benefit, the overall welfare bill per head, Â£3,086, is lower in Scotland than in large parts of northern England.  The tax take from Scotland is only outranked by London, illustrating how Scots and their businesses are making their contribution to UK coffers, the report said. Not only did the North Sea bonanza swell Britain's public purse, but the nation's heavy smokers, though banned from smoking in public places before the rest of Britain, swelled the tobacco duty contributions disproportionately, contributing more than Â£1bn a year out of a UK Â£8bn.  Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said: ""This destroys the myth that Scotland is anything other than a resource-rich nation, well capable of flourishing with independence. Of course, the myth of the subsidised Scot has been peddled not just by Westminster Tories and the English tabloids , but also by politicians in Scotland for their own partisan ends.""  The Herald's senior commentator, Alf Young, said the picture was far more nuanced than the black and white certainties of London-based tabloids. ""Scotland is not some subsidy-obsessed outrider of the British state, offering little in return by way of tax revenues. There are other parts of the UK which receive higher per capita allocations of public expenditure.""",0

I, Robot 2: All we know on this one is that itâs in the scripting stages still, with a potential 2010 release date planned in. No news on Mr Smith's involvement.  I Am Legend 2: Warnerâs huge Christmas 2007 hit could also have a follow up, although itâd be interesting to see if Will Smith returned to it.

"well from your article  ""Fannie, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., don't lend money, to minorities or anyone else, however. They purchase loans from the private lenders who actually underwrite the loans.""  -like I've been saying.  combine that with:  ""Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent""  -which i earlier explained is a huge amount of risky debt to hold. Especially if you're bundling all these mortgages together and selling them off as bonds. Fannie and Freddie were whats known as GSE's (government sponsored enterprise). A problem with GSE's is that many investors like AIG, Lehman Brothers, China, banks, etc. view debt issued by GSE's as risk free because they think the government wont allow the debt to default. Essentially, GSE debt ended up being viewed as Treasury debt with higher return and the same risk. Turns out that wasn't the case now all this debt issued by GSE's has questionable value and its making everything go to shit.  In the end it looks like your article was written by somebody who doesn't know how this whole system works.",0

" Crap! That's scary!  Tens of Thousands Affected In 1996, Aslin requested his files (to which he was entitled under the Public Information Act) and learned for the first time how the authorities had justified the forced sterilizations. ""They termed us feeble-minded idiots, and wrote that our children would be like us or even worse,"" he declares. He was so infuriated at the insult that he filed suit against the state of Michigan, seeking compensation. His claim was turned down last March because the statute of limitations had expired. But Aslin intends to fight on. If a higher court accepts his appeal, the consequences could be far-reaching. For Fred Aslin and his siblings were not an isolated case.  From 1907 onward, at least 60,000 Americans were sterilized against their will. The legal basis for these forced sterilizations was provided by so-called eugenics laws. Most compulsory sterilizations occurred in the 1930s and '40s, but some states, such as Virginia, continued the practice until the late 1970s. Most of the victims were poor and members of minorities, and none of them received compensation, according to Paul Lombardo, professor of law and bioethics at the University of Virginia. A Strong Eugenics Movement in the USA It is not widely known that there was a strong eugenics movement not only in Germany, but in the USA as well. The doctrine, hatched in the second half of the 19th century, combined elements of social Darwinism with the Mendelian theory of heredity. Its advocates pushed for perfecting the human ""gene pool"" by influencing the reproductive process. Their ongoing attempts at achieving a ""perfect"" society included aggressive - and in the case of the Nazis, murderous - actions against marginal groups and minorities.  American scientists played a vanguard role in the eugenics movement, which also had its supporters in Scandinavia, Latin America and Japan. U.S. biologists like Charles B. Davenport and Harry H. Laughlin advocated keeping the ""Anglo-American race"" pure. Their premise was that most ailments, as well as such social problems as poverty and criminality, were hereditary in nature. Therefore persons with a ""good genetic makeup"" should be encouraged to have families, while ""inferior"" people of allegedly poor genetic stock should be prevented from reproducing. Among those people regarded as inferior were epileptics, manic-depressives, prostitutes, alcoholics, the homeless and criminals. Under the eugenics laws, people who came to the negative attention of the social authorities could be branded as ""feeble-minded"" by court order and legally forced to undergo steriliziation. A Model for the Nazis By the early 1930s, some 30 American states had adopted eugenics laws. Most of them were modeled after the law which Harry H. Laughlin had drafted for the state of Virginia in 1924. That legislation found emulators outside the United States too. For example, it served Germany's National Socialists as a model for their 1933 ""Law for Protection Against Genetically Defective Offspring,"" on the basis of which at least 400,000 men and women were forcibly sterilized. More than 200,000 handicapped or allegedly handicapped people were also murdered by the Nazis. The University of Heidelberg was apparently so grateful to eugenicist Laughlin that it awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1936 for his ""services on behalf of racial hygiene.""  In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of Virginia's sterilization law. This was followed by a swift rise in the number of forced sterilizations in the United States. American eugenicists also pushed for anti-immigration measures and stricter laws to prevent racially mixed marriages. In a speech to the U.S. Congress, Laughlin had argued that ""morally and intellectually inferior"" immigrants from eastern and southern Europe were polluting America's genetic potential. The 1924 Immigration Restriction Act reduced by two thirds the immigration quotas for people from those parts of Europe. In signing the new law, President Calvin Coolidge said: ""America must remain American."" Pseudo-Science at Universities For a time, the doctrine of eugenics exerted considerable influence on American society. Based largely on political and social prejudices, the pseudo-science was taught at schools and universities. Leading institutions, such as Harvard, Cornell and Columbia, offered courses in eugenics. Prominent industrialists like cornflakes magnate J. H. Kellogg supported the creation of eugenics groups and organizations. So-called fitter family contests were held at country fairs, with citizens parading their ""good genes."" Movies like ""The Black Stork"" propagated eugenic sterilization.  During the 1940s, however, the theory of eugenics came under increasing criticism because of its racial prejudices and its lack of scientific foundation. Most American sterilization laws were abandoned during the 1950s. In 1980, former psychiatric patients who had been forced into sterilization banded together for a class-action suit, demanding compensation from the state of Virginia. But a federal judge rejected their suit on the grounds that the U.S. Supreme Court had affirmed the constitutionality of sterilization back in 1927. That Supreme Court ruling was never fought, even in subsequent years. As a result, future damage claims have little prospect of success. And the victims of eugenic forced sterilization have no lobbying power to achieve out-of-court settlements.  Two current exhibits are attempting to shed light on this repressed chapter of American history. The Jewish Federation of Los Angeles, in cooperation with the Goethe Institute, is showing an exhibition of photographs and documents titled ""Polluting the Pure."" And the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, a genetics research institute in the state of New York, is featuring an online exhibit on the history of the American eugenics movement.* Between 1910 and 1940, the venerable Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory on Long Island housed the Eugenics Record Office, the central research facility of the American eugenics movement. Most of the exhibit's 1,200 documents come from its archives.  * http://vector.cshl.org/eugenics/",0

"I have noticed after reading some accounts from posters on these boards how much a priori reasoning has again imposed itself on the thinking of many people.  Some are equivocating who is the instigator/offender/offensive element and who is on the reactionary/defender element of this conflict.  Those who are skeptical of the surge and Iraqi progress contend that it is the Mahdi Army who is on the offensive, when in fact it is the opposite...the ISF is on the offensive to assert its control of the country.  Like it is said in the article above, there cannot be two militaries...it's either an Iraqi army or the Mahdi army.  Everyone who cares about the fate of the people in Iraq to live in a free society will put their chips and support behind the Iraqi army.

"    to be 100 percent honest, I was never a huge McCaing supporter either. I just thought that some of Obama policies were terrible for our country. It has nothing to do with him, but rather the policies and beliefs that his party. Saying that, I think we can both agree that there is no perfect candidate for president. Every American has a view of what their perfect president would be and they all differ. I am wholeheartedly rooting for America to pick itself up and get this country going, but this blaming the problem on republicans or democrats is illogical.  I am happy that people can elect a black president I just wish his policies aligned with my views. Oh well, in all reality, I am still going to finish college, keep working, and the president cannot control that. I am only going to worry about what I can control which is my own life.",0

"hmm,   i can appreciate what your both saying esp if you have benefitted from his decisions   i think london is better now than it was before him, lookin back london was a grimey place not long ago, it still has its problems but there are a lot more good points than there a few years ago  but this is whatÂ i think about ken, he is essentially a gambler, a lot of the projects he has launched are with borrowed money, that means that the project needs to pay for itself or WE get the bill, you wont get this bill through the mail, everything else will slowly get more expensive,   my personal opinion is that ken hasnt opened THAT many doors for londoners, just a few more for the those who can afford it,  ive worked in a lot of places with a whole range of people andÂ ive worked with some reprobates, people so thick its painful to look at them at times  i can only assume that its notÂ that hard to find work, it just depends on how badly u want the work or what your pride will allow you to do,  i wouldnt vote for him just cos i worked for him directly or indirectly, job is a job is a job, u could just as easily get work for a construction or media company with a conservative on the board of directors   my point is tho, i dont know if kens gambles will pay off,Â i hope so, but ultimately it is out of our hands and time will tell,  if tony blair and his lot are anything to go by, we could be in trouble   boris is funny at times, and i think his bufoonery is exagerated as he is reported to have a good business record, but i dont trust the tories,    going on personalities i think ken has had his turn, a lot of blind eyes have been turned and he will get caught soon doing something that could effect our reputation,  boris is a mug ken is a c*nt the liberal dude is a gay copper  turd sandwich or giant douche anyone?     if he runs i might vote greg dyke who has a fantastic surname, good record, stood up to the gov when he needed to and suffered as a consequence but it showed he has some balls, he is from london, lives in london and isnt affliated to any of the partys",0

"It's the ""Oh Shit!"" Moment on Iran  by  Dave Lindorff | March 12, 2008 - 8:18am  Everyhorrormovie has that ""Oh Shit!"" moment, when the hero or heroes arehuddled insome creepy hideout, and suddenly something happens thattells you thatthe monster is just around the corner, or just about toattack. In""Jurassic Park"" it was the pulsing ripples in a cup ofwater, heraldingthe arrival of a T-Rex. In ""Jaws"" it was the deep bassmusic, lettingyou know that a monstrous shark was about to attack. Well,we justgot our ""Oh Shit!"" moment with the just-announced resignationof AdmiralWilliam J. Fallon, the military commander of US Middle Eastoperations. Adm.Fallon, 63, famously said that an attack onIran would not happen ""on mywatch,"" and is widely believed to havealready threatened, along with anumber of other top generals andadmirals, to quit the service if theBush administration were to launchan air attack on Iran. Put thepieces together. We know that thevice president is obsessed with adesire to attack Iran, and has beensince before he even took office.Bush has repeatedly stressed thatIran cannot be permitted to continuewith its nuclear processing (hecalls it their ""nukular"" bomb program,though there is no evidence thatthe country has a nuclear bombdevelopment program, and in fact thelast National Intelligence Estimateon Iran said there was not andhadn't been since 2003). And Fallon hasnow quit. The Eisenhowernuclear aircraft carrier strike forcehas departed for stationing offIran, joining forces already in placethere, and loaded to the brimwith strike aircraft, Tomahawk missiles,and even nuclear weapons. Itwas long ago reported that stealth bombershad been put in place income of the countries of the old Soviet Unionnorth of Iran, as well ason the island of Diego Garcia in the IndianOcean. All theelements, that is to say, are in place for amassive air assault onIranian targets, designed to destroy its nuclearprogram, cripple itsmilitary command and control, and--at least this isa stated Cheneygoal--to lead to the overthrow of the Iranian governmentby its ownpeople. It is, of course, the strategy of madmen. TheUShas no forces to send into Iran. All they can do is bomb it.Andbombing a country doesn't lead its people to rise up. It leads themtorally 'round the flag. Especially when the civilian casualties ofournot-so-""smart"" bombs start to soar. If such an attack weretohappen, we can kiss goodbye to six years of domestic peace, suchaswe've had. The Iranians have considerable capability to inflictdamageon US targets of interest, both overseas and here in the domesticUSusing assymetrical warfare techniques. The worse part is, they'dbecompletely justified in doing so, since any attack on them would beacrime against peace--the gravest of all international crimes. Americantroopsalready mired and pinned down in a war in Iraq, would findthemselvessuddenly under attack by Shia forces there, who for severalyears nowhave been largely leaving them alone. And oil, whichjust bumpedup against $110 a barrel, an all-time record, will doublein priceovernight, as the whole Persian Gulf becomes a war zone. Wecanexpect massive launches of small boats armed with missilesandtorpedoes, as well as sophisticated anti-ship missiles fromshorebatteries, all fired at US ships in the Gulf, and it wouldbeastounding if some or even many vessels of the US fleet weren't sunk. Meanwhile,tankertraffic in the Gulf, which accounts for 20% or more of theworld's oil,will cease as insurance rates for those vessels goesthrough the roof. Themonster of war will be unleashed, and willnot easily be defeated.That's why Adm. Fallon was so opposed to thewhole idea. He knows thatit will be a disaster for the US militarily,economically andpolitically. The worst part is that Cheneyknows this, too. Hejust doesn't care. This is the man's parting shotas he leavesoffice--to put the country into the throes of a war sovicious that noone will think of pursuing him for his long list ofcrimes against thenation and the Constitution. He isguessing--and he may beright--that the American public will,sheep-like as always, rally to thecause, with a new round of yellowmagnet ""ribbons"" on their cars. He ishoping--and he may be right--thatwar will be a boon for the candidacyof Republican John McCain and forembattled Republicans running forCongress. It's a kind of political Hail Mary.  Source",0

"  The reason they compared it to the US is because the Romans had about the same system of government a Republic. Less government, less taxes, the people were free.

This caused a collapse of their economy and the Empire broke down. This is what happened to the United States and it might come crashing down just like the Roman Empire.",0

WOW cuz its so important to know about that.  I say 1 time put both in a room with normal people to ask questions and lets see what happens.  thats all i really mad at everything else is fun to watch, hell even snl got a laugh out of me on the palin look a like.",0

"Ok, I read the whole article. The most I saw was that as of 2006 Fannie and Freddie had gone from holding 56% to 24% of subprime loans. Thats a reduction yes, but in portfolio terms that is still a HUGE amount weighted toward a risky asset.  The bundled mortgage securities that fannie and freddie offer were seen as minimal risk investments and the fact that 24% of there holdings were in the subprime market sounds downright ludicrous to me.  However, maybe i missed something in the article saying that they only held a small percentage of these loans. can you point me to it?",0

"BUMP FOR UPDATE As I suspected, the ""Hillary raised $10 million online overnight"" report that the Washington Post ran with earlier today was too good to be true. I don't know if the mistake is the reporter's or if someone at Camp Hillary was spinning a bit too fast, but there's no way they raised that much since her win in Pennsylvania yesterday.  An email from Terry McAuliffe, Clinton campaign chairman, that I received three hours ago, says ""More than 50,000 people have contributed to the campaign for the very first time in the last 24 hours alone."" If 80% of Clinton's donations are from new givers, that implies a total number of about 60,000 donations. If we're very generous and assume an average donation of $100, which is high for first-time donors, that gives Clinton a current take of at most $6 million.  Reading the Post's report from its Trail blog, which was by Matthew Mosk, it looks like the over-spin came from Hassan Nemazee, a finance co-chair for Clinton and longtime Democratic fatcat. A Google search shows Nemazee fed the same line to Business Week, which cited him for the news that Clinton supposedly took in $10 million by 2pm this afternoon.  Why am I bothering to knock this particular claim down to size? Because 90% of politics is about perception, and if a campaign is perceived to be running out of money, or floating in money, that affects what other people will think and do about it. Internet-driven fundraising is an amazing thing, because the costs are so low and the speed so seemingly instantaneous. But anyone who reports on it should be careful to remember that the campaigns can easily hype these numbers, and by the time anyone checks for the truth it won't matter.  The same is true, by the way, for the Obama campaign, as Patrick Ruffini has shown that the Obama campaign's online widget showing its donor total has occasionally behaved in odd ways. The best solution to this problem of verifiability, and the lack thereof, would be real-time donation transparency, as was practiced by the Ron Paul campaign. Unfortunately, that's hardly likely from a major campaign any time soon.  [If you're reading this story because of a link from the HuffPost or Fark.com, I've updated my reporting here. It looks like Clinton did rake in $10M as of sometime late yesterday, based on a claimed total of 100,000 donations since Tuesday night.}",0

Thank God the great state of Texas still upholds the law and protects its citizens. If more states would wake the fuck up and put more of these assholes to sleep this kind of shit would slow down to a near halt. Too bad they won't air these executions on pay per view. Then we could give the proceeds to the victims families and some of these fucking animals would see for themselves what rape and murder will get you. DEAD!

"http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=343&sid=1429208  Supreme Court says Americans have right to guns By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court says Americans have a right to own guns for self-defense and hunting, the justices' first major pronouncement on gun rights in U.S. history.  The court's 5-4 ruling strikes down the District of Columbia's 32-year-old ban on handguns as incompatible with gun rights under the Second Amendment. The decision goes further than even the Bush administration wanted, but probably leaves most firearms laws intact.  The court had not conclusively interpreted the Second Amendment since its ratification in 1791. The amendment reads: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""  The basic issue for the justices was whether the amendment protects an individual's right to own guns no matter what, or whether that right is somehow tied to service in a state militia.

Have you not read what I have been writing.  Just because 84% of these bad loans were not made by Fannie or Freddie does not mean that Fannie or Freddie did not come to own these loans.

  Shrek 4 was announced ages ago but animated movies usually take a couple of years to make so I think it comes out next year.

"Tue Jun 3, 5:00 PM ET    OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. soldiers who have deserted the military because of the war in Iraq should be allowed to stay permanently in Canada, the House of Commons voted in a nonbinding motion on Tuesday.  ADVERTISEMENT  The three opposition parties, which together hold a majority of seats in the House, backed a motion that said the government should allow conscientious objectors and their families ""who have refused or left military service related to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations"" to stay in Canada.  Canada was a haven for tens of thousands of draft dodgers during the Vietnam War and has attracted an estimated 175 to 200 Americans who are resisting the Iraq conflict.  ""I think Canada has always been a place which has welcomed those who seek peace and seek freedom,"" Bob Rae, foreign affairs spokesman for the main opposition Liberal Party, told reporters outside the Commons after the vote.  The minority Conservative government opposes the idea, arguing that, unlike during the Vietnam War, the current U.S. military is composed of volunteers, and also that Washington allows people to apply for conscientious objector status.  ""People do not join with their eyes closed. If they do, then they have their own problems,"" Conservative Member of Parliament Laurie Hawn, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Canadian Air Force, said during debate on the motion.  The Supreme Court of Canada refused last November to hear appeals of two U.S. deserters whose applications for refugee status had been turned down by immigration authorities.

"I don't believe that women and men are equal, it is something women are still trying to strive towards this very day.  I don't think it is a matter of time, education or ""playing nice"" but rather lack of experience and setting a higher bar for oneself (demand more). Women need to be more demanding and stand up for what they believe in. There is nothing wrong with having your voice heard or making a man serve you.  In ancient times it was a common thing to have men for slaves, ones that worshipped their goddess. By demanding more from men and holding that power that we truly have but have lost over time (threw greedy white men) it is a matter of regaining and utilizing what we have inside of us.  Being in control doesn't always have to be associated with bdsm or even being a control freak. Control, domination and power can come in many levels. It is a matter of what you want out of your own life and using what you are comfortable with.  All in all, be yourself!",0

"Let's briefly recap waterboarding in the US for some of the more senile, shellshocked, and/or generally stupid Americans who support this torture:  -As far back as the Spanish-American War, American servicemen were court-martialed for waterboarding suspected insurgents in the Philippines.  -Japanese troops and the Nazi Gestapo used this torture. Japanese were later convicted of war crimes due to their use of the practice on American POWs.  -During the Vietnam war, US Generals declared the practice illegal and several court martials occurred due to the revelation that the practice was being carried out by US and South Vietnamese troops.   The Imperial Japanese, the Fascist Nazis, the Pinochet regime, the Khmer Rouge, etc have all used waterboarding. And now the US does. Nice company we keep, don't you think?",0

He said that Iraq DID have WMD's, that they hid information, that they had spies int he inspection teams, that they knew when the inspectors were coming. Inspectors would be held up at one gate and could watch convoys of trucks leave at another gate.  The truth in Syria is that North Korea was working with Syria to build nukes - in contravention of their agreement with the U.S. not to do so in return for fuel supplies. That agreement was worked out by one Jimmy Carter under the auspices of the Clinton administration. The North Koreans later admitted that they violated the treaty from the very beginning.",0

False accusations are wrong.Â  Accusations based on circumstance with no proof are wrong.Â  Taking the authority of law into your own hands is wrong.Â  You think they got those lessons?  Most schools have a policy regard handling of cash.Â  I'd guess it was a violation of the policy to keep the money (no matter how small the amount) in an unsecured location at the school.  It could have been another teacher, a janitor or any other adult to take the money -- it could have even been mistakenly mixed up with other papers or thrown out (have you ever seen a teacher's desk in the middle of the day?)  In the public climate that exists regarding 'touching' students these days Im amazed that any educator would even go there.",0

"  Indeed they do. You're never seen a puter in the Oval Office.  But you'd have to expect that anyone who is the least bit curious about anything, and wants to see what's really out there besides what is digested by staff, would have a desktop in the private office off the Oval.Â  AlsoÂ a desktop for notes, e-mail, and writing, especially while in transit.  You would expect that with IT so critical to the economy and national security, the Commander-In-Chief would have at least a nodding acquaintance with hacks, viruses, broadband, and such.  He should also know that CERT is not a breath mint.  If there is a generation gap between the majority of the people and Senator McCain, this is another tellingÂ example.  And if this is just a continuation of the incuriosity, inattention, and vincible ignorance of the current president, so much the worse.  ""What color is the red phone?"" -- George W. Bush",0

To some Iraqis, we may be terrorists. But to us Americans, we are not terrorists. Its just how you view it. I don't agree with Iraq, I support pulling out, and taking care of our problems here. Besides, although our government is pretty much lazy and getting paid for doing nada, that does not mean that the rest of the country does not care. We do alot for the world, and we try to act out of morals and good hearts. I'm serious. We give aid to countries in need, we try to have a equal and fair country, we support values and good will, and we are very optimistic people. We try to be a good force in the world, even though it may not seem like it to you. I'm proud of this country and what it has done for the world, even though it has made some stupid mistakes. Such as this war. But, with all good comes the bad, and the in between. Nothing is perfect in life.",0

"HOPKINSVILLE, Ky. - A class of third-grade students got a lesson in civil liberties when an envelope containing $5 disappeared from their teacher's desk.  The students at Martin Luther King Elementary in Hopkinsville were asked to remove their shoes and socks during a search. Some were patted down and had their pockets checked. Some parents were angered by the Feb. 15 searches, which did not turn up the missing money at the western Kentucky school. ""The way they treat our students is ridiculous,"" said Zlatko Skuljan, the father of a 9-year-old girl in the class. The school's principal gave written reprimands to four instructors who had physical contact with the students. The principal, Sarah Newman, declined to comment and phone numbers for the four teachers could not be located Wednesday. Christian County Schools spokeswoman Regan Huneycutt said the search violated the school district's policy. School employees can touch students only when the student poses a threat to another student or to themselves. School officials said the search was prompted by the disappearance of an envelope containing $5 for a school function that was on the teacher's desk. The students' regular teacher was absent that day.  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080227/ap_on_fe_st/odd_students_sea rched;_ylt=ApBpqqqYP5pGKaE8WfSqKPztiBIF",0

ThenÂ down the chain to an IBM Executive, with type bars.  The next shop had correcting Selectrics, until the owner bought me a DECmate for Christmas.  Then secretaries became an endangered species.

I should have handled it the old Irish way, but on the advice of those closest to me, I refrained.  Heh, Maybe I will send that thiefing som bitch a piece of rope and one of those witty Irish quotes and let him think about that not everyone he screw's is going to let it slide, or maybe one day he will turn around and there I'll be, to explain to him about honesty and integrity and when someone charges $300.00 bucks an hour, he damn well better earn it.",0

Those lazy mother fuckers need a couple more jobs and maybe sell their ass on the street huh?  With the price of tax going up it would pay for YOUR health care. YOU are not paying for anyone else. add it up dumb ass. My husbands parents pay 1700 each a month for their health care. Do you know why it is so high? Because that is how much Kaiser decided to charge them that much, no reason. But with free health care you get so much more. free mental health. free doctors visits. free medicine. free surgery. free dentistry. ect!  Do you have any idea how much, in our current world that would cost to get insurance for? wayy more than we would be paying on taxes a month.  Yes taking the insanely rich More than the poor is a good thing. McCain WANTS to tax the POOR more and give tax cuts to the rich. When I say insanely rich I do not mean like 60 k a year.

"Do you suffer from a persecution/victim complex?  Nobody is ""setting Obama up."" He has been a media darling for well over a year; since the 2004 Democratic convention, as a matter of fact. It takes a mighty thick tinfoil hat to believe the media is suddenly going to pull the rug out from under him in an effort to give Hillary the nomination.  They might drop the guillotine once the General Election campaign starts, but I honestly doubt they're writing Hillary's obituary as some sort of reverse-psychology to resurrect her campaign with ""underdog"" votes.  Fact is, Hillary is set to win West Virginia by double-figures and has maintained a 20% + lead in opinion polls there for months, well before any of the post-North Carolina ""Hillary is toast"" chatter.  She is also heavily favored to win Kentucky and Puerto Rico by double digits, but if she doesn't keep Oregon close the media will continue to declare Hillary dead in the water.",0

"The following are the Justices on the Supreme Court and which president nominated them:  Chief Justice John Roberts - George W. Bush (considered to be more on the conservative end) Associate Justice John Paul Stevens - Gerald Ford (considered to be one of the more liberal members on the court) Associate Justice Antonin Scalia - Ronald Reagan (considered to be the most conservative on the court) Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy - Ronald Reagan (most moderate on the bench) Associate Justice David Souter - George H.W. Bush (votes with the liberal wing) Associate Justice Clarence Thomas - George H.W. Bush (votes with the conservative wing) Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg - Bill Clinton (one of the more liberal voting justices) Associate Justice Stephen Breyer - Bill Clinton (votes with the liberal wing) Associate Justice Samuel Alito - George W. Bush (considered to be more conservative)  Essentially, this is still a split court. You have 4 conservatives (Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito) and 4 liberals (Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer).  And then you have the swing vote in Kennedy.  Now please, explain to me how this Supreme Court is a ""Republican controlled Supreme Court.""",0
"   No, no, no...that's not how these tele-evangelists get 100 million bones in the bank and still have the nerve to ask for donations for $36 million Gulfstream jets that cost $6000/month to maintain.  It's the stupid message of ""Give a bunch of money to my ministry and you will be just as rich in return!""  The church I used to go to, which to me was quite unlistenable as the pastor's only message was about he got shot and he's now prosperous as the congregation helped him put a huge downpyment on a Lexus, was nothing but a pit stop for donations.  This was Jesse Duplantis--in trouble with eyeballers of ministry finances all over--message EVERY TIME I begrudgingly saw him.ÃÂ   ""Everyone...stand up!""  ""If you are debt-free....sit down!""  ""Everyone else that's standing...if you want to be rich and prosper...BUY MY BOOKS!""ÃÂ  (WTF???)  After that, it was a bunch of stupid jokes that I'd heard before.  I never had the money to give and I never got the ""you're blessed by what you give"" mantra, because that's just wrong quite frankly, but at least my parents stopped this donation crap once I let them in on the ponzi scheme run by many of these big shots.  Benny Hinn's skank daughter gets a senior summer trip from donations...that was their sign to stop.  It's people's greed on both sides, that's all there is to that.",0

"What part are you going for? Alex, I hope :)    It's really hard to find other books like ACwO... The kinds of things that come up as 'similar' to it are Catch-22, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, Slaughterhouse-5... You could do something from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but I really wouldn't know which part. Or something from The Wasp Factory?    There are some fair monologues in American Psycho, although I guess Bateman isn't close enough to an 'Alex' to convince your teachers you could play the part...

"I respect christopher hitchens for subjecting himself to this to learn more and be more credible when writing about it. This is great journalism. I wish whoever becomes presidnt would have the balls to do this before deciding on it. Even in war it used to be leaders would lead on the field in battle. george washington lead in the field. Today presidents lead wars from air conditioned offices.  Also black journalist need to step up, we should of volunteered for this first and make news on the subject. As a spoken Word artist who wants to write a poem on the subject I am willing to volunteer for it but dont know how to make it happen.  I wonder could I bet hitchens. I think all I would have to do is just hold my breath for 1 minute. How hard could that be? You go under water you can hold your breathe for one minute. Why did it look painless? he said the CIA says about 30 seconds is average for the arabs being subjected to it. We need to see a waterboarding video of the real thing. And how in the hell is playing pop music gonna terrify hitchens? that music is only annoying to muslim extremist. They should of found out the worse music hitchens likes and used that.",0

"Women have made great strides here in the past few decades, thanks in part to the feminist movement. Women have more opportunities available to them now than they've ever had. (At least in recorded history). They are now able compete in more sports than ever before and they now have equal access to colleges and schools and to most careers. And now with equal access women are showing that they can hang and even outshine the boys. More women than men are going to college and more are graduating and starting new careers. On some campuses almost 70% of the student population is female. Women are taking on more leadership responsibilites and some tests show that women in general make better managers or leaders. Women in their twenties in most large cities in the US are actually making more money than the men in their own age group. A lot of successful women are finding it hard to find a man who makes what they make. More and more, women are actually making more than their husband of boyfriend. I do believe society has become more feminized. Just look at the news with the war in Iraq. Ever since Vietnam, people have begun to question war and the need for it. Women historically have never been in favor of war and most men are becomming that way. I believe Women are definately making a huge mark on history at this very moment and I do believe we will see more of a female influence on leadership, politics, education, etc. etc. etc. where before they never had a voice.",0

"I can't beleive people are still talking about this.... well my theroies... Tarantino was once quizzed about the plaster/band-aid on the back of is neck, he responded by saying that Ving Rhames (Marselius Wallace) has a scar on the back of his neck, it was thought that this would be too distracting as he's a perfectionist and wanted the shot from the back of his head. Whoever made up the Devil-Removing-soul-from-back-of-next-(fact) is laughing his fucking ass of, because that has never been said in ANY documented writtings about Beelezebub (that i've found, feel free to correct me).  As for the contents of the case... Elvis's Gold Suit. Featured in Tarantino's True Romance (i know i know he only wrote it, don't feel free to correct me). Okay so i don't have much in the way of proof but this is Tarantino's quest he creates questions so people keep on talking about it for years to come. Like we're doing now.      Why is Reservoir Dogs called Reservoir Dogs?    I therefore rest my case m'lord.    Be Cool.",0

Benedict XVI was declared Pope in 2005.... 2005 + 7 = 2012.... and he's old as it is (by the way, I'm baptist, not catholic)  but then again, Revelation says no one will know when it's happening",0

"I've found that the people who complain about it being like high school are the same people that went to high school within 25-30 miles of it. That's the problem with a lot of commuter schools, (I grew up near Sacramento State).    I've also found that the people who love it tend to be the one's who get themselves involved. I moved onto campus at CSULB 2 1/2 years ago not knowing a single person -- and now I know plenty of people. I have more friends now than I did in high school and a more active social life for sure. And I was damn busy with my life in high school!        College is what you make it.      Although I will say that the lack of football or other tailgating sport may contribute to the lack of school spirit. But, really, often when I'm out and about wearing CSULB stuff (either in northern or southern california) people will come up and start talking to me about our sports anyway...

"Absolutely not. Health care is a personal choice. People die in hospitals all the time. If your beliefs are not main stream its your choice. Nobody has the right to force an adult into any treatment. Minors are a different story but even then they should have control of choice before 18. We had a kid with some type of cancer here who refused traditional care and his parentsd supported him. I think he was around 16 at the time the court battles started. After a few court battles he won his case and is still alive. It could have killed him but he had the right, its his body. Dont even try to tell I have to follow traditional medical procedures. My body, my choice.",0
"After so many broken promises, integration is key.By Alfred Kokh  from the October 15, 2008 edition  Moscow - It's a truism that stable and friendly relations between two countries require each to look at a situation from the other's point of view. The recent tussle between Russia and the West over Georgia is a stark reminder of how the United States has fundamentally never understood Russia's point of view.  The conventional view is that Russia in recent years has been pushing away from the West. But the reverse is more accurate. The Russia-Georgia conflict is a consequence of the West's ""pushing away"" of Russia.  Russia needed a good friend to stand by her side the past 15 years, to counsel her on becoming an open, democratic country tightly bound to the West. Russia thought it had found a friend in America. Unfortunately, despite the desire of Russia's newly formed leadership to move closer to the West, to be integrated to Western institutions, there was no move to meet Russia partway. All issues of integration were talked away during the many years of negotiations, and all questions of economic aid ended up as miserly loans from the World Bank.  Having worked in Boris Yeltsin's government as a deputy prime minister, I know how the West tried to persuade Russia to take on the entire foreign debt of the former USSR. Russia agreed to take this very difficult step in the hope that the West would appreciate its sacrifice and begin seeing the world through its eyes. Unfortunately that did not happen. Yeltsin's government ended up with almost no allies or supporters in Russia. He was perceived as a puppet of the West, his policies dictated by the US. It should come as no surprise, then, that Vladimir Putin came to power as he did in 1999.  Now, the West considers Prime Minister Putin a foe of democracy. But he was the first to support America after 9/11, and he provided substantial help in organizing operations in Afghanistan. Putin made simple requests in return: membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), dropping visa entry requirements to European Union (EU) countries, and significant cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). All this was promised to him and none of it happened.  Let's imagine for a moment that Russia had been integrated into the West. Then the corruption of the Russian judicial system and its susceptibility to administrative pressure would be balanced by European judicial institutions and the imperfections of its electoral system would be muted by European legislation and the European parliament. The government's economic policies would be in accord with the norms of the EU and WTO and Russia's military independence would be constrained by NATO rules. The human rights situation in Russia would be very different.  The West would only win in this scenario. Instead, it has surrounded Russia with missiles and radar stations and accumulated conventional weapons in close proximity to its borders. It would be naive to expect Russia to make concessions such as ratifying the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty under these conditions. Opinion polls show that promoting pro-Western policies in Russia today without an equivalent response from the West would be political suicide for Russian leaders. Neither the military establishment nor citizens would support such concessions.  The situation in Georgia is a global embarrassment, a tale of contradictions. And, the reaction from Russians and Americans is, simply put, ironic. Russian leaders were crying crocodile tears over the genocide of Ossetians, and voicing outrage over the shelling of Tskhinvali. But they had done the very same thing in Chechnya just a few years ago. The American administration is no better, attacking Iraq for bogus reasons, destroying an entire nation, inciting further religious terrorism, and killing tens of thousands of civilians.  To understand Russia's actions in Georgia, the West must first understand that Russia does not see herself as the losing side that must be punished for the cold war. Second, there is a dangerous historic precedent: In 1919, the Entente forced Germany to sign the humiliating Treaty of Versailles. Historians suggest that the repercussions of that Treaty led to World War II. Had the Allies looked at the situation from the German point of view, history may have taken a better course.  Perhaps the conflict in the Caucasus will at least force the West to talk to Russia about real integration â WTO membership, for example. For if Russia continues to be ""pushed away"" â left alone with its anxieties and the anxieties of its leaders â relations will definitely sour. Do not forget how many nuclear warheads Russia has and how many Russians want to save the country's honor.   â¢ Alfred Kokh is the author of the upcoming book, ""A Crate of Vodka: An Insider View On The 20 Years That Shaped Modern Russia."" He served as a deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin. This text was translated by Antonina W. Bouis.",0

"What really ruined The Transformers movie is the fact that Michael Bay is not a fan of the transformers, and he stated he did'nt want to make a cartoon of the Transformers, The Transformations were to complex, the transformations of the Transformers from past shows were never complex, they were promoting stuff that took away space for putting more information in the script ( Like Mountain Dew, X-Box, ect. ), They had one of the Original voice actors ( Optimus Prime ( AKA Petter Cullen ), and not the other ( Frank Welker ( AKA Megatron ), Way tomany quotes slaming the original series, Not having Bumblebee a VW bug, and yet having a VW bug in the movie!, none of the desgins looked anything near the original desgins of the Transformers, Not having the Matrix Of Leadership, and instead we get some stupid cube ( Hey was'nt the cube in one of the later Transformers shows ), Bay and Hasbro TRANSFORMED this movie in to a pile of crap! ( Anyone feel free to add the transfomation sound effect! ), the whole witwikey background story, and the selling of his gradfathers glasses could have been deleted, and something better put in, I only payed $2.00 to see Transformers, and to be frank it's not even worth $2.00, that would be an insult to the movies that deserve the admition price of $2.00 LOL!",0

"Friday, April 11, 2008   Associated Press WASHINGTONÂ âÂ  The Bush administration is likely to move its research on one of the most contagious animal diseases from an isolated island laboratory to the U.S. mainland near herds of livestock, raising concerns about a catastrophic outbreak. Skeptical Democrats in Congress are demanding to see internal documents they believe highlight the risks and consequences of thedecision. An epidemic of the disease, foot and mouth, which only affectsanimals, could devastate the livestock industry.  One such government report, produced last year and already turned over to lawmakers by the Homeland Security Department, combined commercial satellite images and federal farm data to show the proximity to livestock herds of locations that have been considered for the new lab. ""Would an accidental laboratory release at these locations have the potential to affect nearby livestock?"" asked the nine-page documentÂ· It did not directly answer the question. Read the Rest",0

"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080610/wl_afp/europeinflationprote stenergytransport  Two truck drivers killed as fuel strike hits hard in Europe  by Olivier Thibault 2 hours, 15 minutes ago  MADRID (AFP) - Two truck drivers were killed on picket lines in Spain and Portugal on Tuesday as strikes by hauliers over soaring fuel prices turned increasingly ugly.    Spanish police escorted petrol tankers into Barcelona as the stoppage, launched Monday, caused food and fuel shortages and huge tailbacks on the Spanish-French border. French railway workers began their own walkout, increasing the transport chaos. A Portuguese driver was killed after he was hit by a truck as he manned a barricade filtering traffic near Alcanena, north of Lisbon. A police spokesman quoted witnesses as saying the 52-year-old man climbed onto the side of a truck in a bid to stop it and fell off under the wheels, Lusa news agency reported. Later Tuesday, a truck driver in southern Spain was run over and killed by a van as he was working on a picket line outside a wholesale market in the southern city of Granada, police said. Other trucks in Portugal and Spain have been stoned or had their windows smashed and tyres punctured for working during the national strikes. Tens of thousands of truckers are on strike or joining the protests to demand government help to offset the higher fuel costs. While new talks with trucker representatives were held in Madrid, authorities in northern Spain ordered emergency measures after many petrol stations in the Catalonia region ran out of fuel. ""Twenty tanker trucks escorted by the regional police left an industrial zone this morning for Barcelona port to help supply and distribute to petrol stations in the region,"" a regional police spokesman told AFP. Forty percent of petrol stations in Catalonia have run out of fuel, according to Manuel Amado, president of the Catalonia Federation of Service Stations. Arrivals of fresh meat, fish and fruit in Madrid have come to a near halt, according to officials at the Mercamadrid market, Spain's biggest wholesale market. They said that fish would be in short supply from Thursday but stocks of other foods should last until the end of the week. Automakers in Spain said most of the country's automobile plants, including those of Nissan, Mercedes Benz, Seat and Renault, have had to cut or halt production. Auto plants are particularly vulnerable to a strike by hauliers, which provide them with spare parts. Truckers stopped lorries from crossing the French-Spain border and caused major tailbacks around major Spanish cities, including Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. Spanish and French truckers staged pickets on either side of the frontier between the two countries. They blocked a bridge on the border at Bidassoa in the western Basque region and other main crossing points. On the French side, service areas on motorways were packed with trucks from the border right back to Bordeaux, about 200 kilometres (125 miles) away. Spain's second largest hauliers' union Fenadismer, which claims to represent 70,000 out of Spain's 380,000 truck drivers, launched an open-ended strike on Monday. Talks Monday between the hauliers and the government ended in failure, Fenadismer said. The Portuguese government said it hoped to have an agreement with its truckers by the end of the week. A separate strike by workers at the French rail company, SNCF, severely hit rail traffic. About half of intercity and local commuter trains were running along with about three quarters of TGV high speed trains from Paris to southwest France. Some express commuter lines into Paris were badly affected by the strike. Spanish fisherman were keeping up their strike against fuel prices but most French trawlers have decided to go back to work after several weeks of blocking ports and access to oil refineries.",0

"  The Supreme Court is completely independent, and was designed that way. The only time that any partisanship has an influence is when the confirmations are taking place.  So tell me, how exactly can any President, party, or politician have ANY influence over a member in the Supreme Court? What can they do? The Justice is nominated for LIFE. What could any party or politician possibly offer to a sitting Supreme Court Justice, when that Justice has a guaranteed job no matter who's in power, and no matter what their decision is?  Think about the 2000 election for a second. What did the Justices who voted to stop the recount (let's remember that the case wasn't about the Supreme Court voting for one candidate or another....if you really think that, please reread the decision) have to gain from doing so? What motive could Justice Scalia and then Chief Justice Rehnquist possibly have in ensuring that one party or another, or one president or another, came to power? Do you know what would have happened to all the sitting ""conservative"" Justices if Gore had won instead? NOTHING. So how did the party have any influence over their decision?",0

"Yes, I've cited those figures. Think about it. Thats two giant institutions holding 24% of volatile debt, pooling it with other mortgages, and selling it off as safe with a wink that its backed by the U.S. government. Plus, these two companies didn't have the same transparency of information rules that other private companies were held to. That is a giant risk.  Although the remaining 76% is held privately. That 76% is probably split up between more than one or two organizations. That mitigates risk. Furthermore, when these private companies were pooling the mortgages they wouldn't be able imply that their bonds would be backed by the U.S. government.",0

"   It's my country too and I say let them stay as long as they are productive and don't break any laws. It's so easy for some people to call someone a coward, when they themselves sit on their easy chair and pontificate about war and other races/religions that they know next to nothing about. They have never fought in a war or even been in the military yet deem to know it all. Till you have faced the stress and horror of war, how do you know how it would affect even you? I would suspect that the ones that have come across our border to stay had no idea that they would be fighting an illegal war and coming here is their only way out.  I remember the wave that came during the Vietnam war and met some that came to BC. They were broken and suffering men that couldn't even talk of the horrors they had seen. So, till you've experienced what they have you certainly can't judge them.",0

He was in fact NOT denied that right.Â  He and his legal council both neglected to request to speak to the Mexican Consular.Â  If they had requested, they would have been granted their request.Â  It wasn't until AFTER his conviction and AFTER his appeals that they finally decided to mention that he wasn't a US citizen, which is what everyone was previously lead to believe.Â   Neither theÂ prosecution, nor the court had any knowledge of the nation of origin of this douche.Â  Due to the circumstances of his conviction, the world court has NO JURISDICTION over this case.Â  They would like to have, and they might try to say that they have it ... but they don't.Â  Even the US Supreme court reviewed it & agreed that the world court has no jurisdiction.",0

"Well, as others have already said, it was at a bar and it is quite silly to judge an entire nation solely on your experience there. It isn't valid evidence for what you are arguing.  However... I do believe that Americans, whilst not being inherently less intelligent, are, on average, more ignorant than other nationalities about the world around them. Why? Americans grow up without many ""outside"" influences in the media - I would say that 98 percent of your television and film content is American made, american produced, directed, acted..... most of the music that gets commercial airplay in the states are also very much american dominated. Also, geographically, america is quite isolated, really.... sure, britain is an island, but it's only a hop skip and a jump to about 20 different countries...",0

"Thing is, the entire time the 'socialist' Europeans have been taxing oil, they have been using that money to build one of the greatest public transport networks imaginable. So for your average joe it ain't going to be that hard to get around, but for the haulage industry it has been hard, as their petrol 'allowance' probably hasn't gone up.  This is has really got me excited, with rising fuel prices, world food shortage and the domestic economy, it seems like the shits hitting the fan hard. I am going to enjoy the next five years.",0

"  Hey, whadaya mean, f*ck up an entire nation? He's just living the american dream! You know, financing two wars with credit cards from china! For as much as has been spent in the wars, is how much the US will have to pay back to china, plus interest. This isn't pinko liberal faggity talk. This is money talk. Some dumbass who got the pulitzer prize in economics wrote a book saying this war is going to cost at least 3 trillion dollars (trillion is a word liberals like to use, 3 syllables). anyway, china will own the US, and bush still doesn't own Iraq, and the US soldiers who don't own their arms or legs or brains will be cared for, until they die, and that bill hasn't even started to come in yet. Wow, sounds like this could be a very interesting movie! Can't wait! I wonder if it will be as sick as the real thing.",0
