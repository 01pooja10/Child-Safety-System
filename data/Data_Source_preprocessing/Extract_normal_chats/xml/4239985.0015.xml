      <body>  I'm sure it's incredibly early to tell, but is this the beginning of the splits of the Republican Party?</body>

      <body>  Not only is his last name "Tinklenberg" his first name is "Elwyn". Not that I give a crap, but it isn't one of those strong Anglo-Saxon names that looks good on a ballot.  He seems to be a pretty decent guy nonetheless, from the debate transcripts I read.  A solid moderate democrat, and not a partisan hack.  TINKLENBERG 08!!</body>

      <body>  I'm not sure if it is a split, but I think the GOP will have to wander in the wilderness for a few years to find itself again at the very least.</body>

      <body>  Most probably that. The GOP needs to, no doubt. Hopefully they will, and drop the social and neoconservative wings of the party.</body>

      <body>  He was up three points earlier but right now is just up two.  Should be interesting.  And she made me get into a fight with a Republican colleague of mine.</body>

      <body>  Do tell.  I would simply say that I am tire of having my patriotism questioned in such a manner.</body>

      <body>  I demanded him show me anything remotely as disgusting...he said he did not have "time to find it."  And then when I smacked him about with more honesty, he told me to leave him alone until I wanted to have an "intelligent conversation" i.e. one where I agree with him.</body>

      <body>  Gawd that sounds familiar.  "your [sic] an idiot" (because you don't agree with me).  I hate to toot my own horn, but I damned well know I am smarter than most people, and when someone who couldn't critically think their way out of a paper bag calls me an idiot, simply because I had the temerity to not buy their brand of crap, it galls me.</body>
