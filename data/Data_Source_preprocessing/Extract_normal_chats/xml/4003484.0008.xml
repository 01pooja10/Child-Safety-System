 <body> That's why the Bush administration decided to "go it alone" in Iraq, instead of sitting around with the lazy asses aka the UN "Security" Council.  If those guys had brains, they'd take em' out and play with em'.</body>

 <body>China, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia are in the Human Wrongs Council.  That tells me nothing right there.</body>

 <body>the US is illegally holding thousands of "suspected terrorists" in secret foreign prisons and in the holds of about 15 to 17 US military sea vessels. Bush and Cheney are war criminals. They came into office with the idea of conquering the middle east and handing over all the oil rights to multinational oil corporations and destroy anyone who'd get in their way. The US right now is the biggest threat in the world to human rights.</body>

 <body>  better to be just war criminals than to be war criminals and hypocrits also??  they did the right thing...if they don't plan on honoring all these past treaties and such, they need to just pull out of them... hopefully an administration in the future will work to restore all the damage this administration has done.</body>

 <body>  It's called common decency. No need to attach "We are the world" to it. But is something we do not possess anymore.</body>

 <body>Thats what your taught in berkeley huh. Maybe one day you will get your wish and those poor "suspected terrorists" will be allowed to freely walk the streets of America. After all it would be the just thing to do after "illegally" holding them against there will. Maybe we can give them a nice big house and a million dollars too. Perhaps a wall, like the Vietnam Memorial, where we can put the names of those terrorists who died "fighting the biggest threat in the world to human rights"</body>

 <body>Its not just terrorists we are talking about here, we have lost all sense of morality. We have lost our value for life and common decency, just look at our city streets. The nation's capital is setting checkpoints to curb crime, "patriots" suggest we shoot illegals on site, our law enforcement is just as corrupt as it is in Mexico, a 78 yr old man gets hit by a car and people just stand around and look, no one runs to help..etc etc. We have become worse then the terrorists we are supposedly fighting in the middle east.</body>

 <body>  I know.....Check Points. Don't people even realize that comes from Nazi Germany? What does that say about America? Anyway I heard they are going to be doing drug check points around these summer concerts that come up every year starting this summer. Man! They might find some serious convicts like a guy who smokes mariajuana!</body>
