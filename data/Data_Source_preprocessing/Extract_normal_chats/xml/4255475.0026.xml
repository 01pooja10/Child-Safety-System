 <body>  haha... Welcome to the movie forum!  If you say you didn't like TDK... All the trolls and fanboys come out of the woodwork to defends Heaths' half ass potrayal of the Joker.  Get used to it... (apparently it's all they got):(</body>

 <body>  Heath's Joker was the closest to Joker in the comics. I suggest you read The Killing Joker, and you'll understand.  Heath is how the Joker was originally written. Jack's Joker was how DC changed him back in the 50's and 60's where they made him more a practical joker then a homicidal mad man.  But to each their own.</body>

 <body> Ok Johnnie. You and the dumbass that you're defending need to go back and read the previous posts that said dumbass contributed to this thread.  Those posts are what makes him a dumbass, not the fact that he doen't like TDK.</body>

 <body>  One of his lesser known movies. He was good in it. His career was barely taking off though, and to be bad he passed away at such a young age.</body>

 <body>  You come off as a jerk because you said that you're glad Heath's dead because you didn't like his performance in The Dark Knight. It's ok if you didn't like the movie or Heath's performance, but to say that you're glad he's dead is what makes someone say you have a low IQ.</body>

 <body>  In career terms that's the tragic thing about his death, that he seemed to be coming into his own as a great actor.</body>

 <body>  I'd say fully emerging yourself into a character that has serious mental issues is a lot more traumatizing than playing a character that has a homosexual relationship.</body>

 <body> I saw some interview with Nicholson when Ledger died...he said he had warned him about the character...or something like that...I think if you get that run down by a character, you are a kook to begin with...and maybe should lay off the narcotics</body>
