 <body>  I guess some guy saw a post I left somewhere, because he was trying very hard to recruit me.  Hit my in box with whole bunch of links, and tried to get all buddy buddy talking about video games.  I lean to the right on a lot of issues (mostly financial, not the cultural stuff) but I have never given it any serious consideration.</body>

 <body>  That's funny...lol "black leprechaun"..But trust me, there are some out there. Just ask Fox News. And besides, one of the local news channels was able to find one when they went to the local Republican Party watch Party last night. They asked this one black guy who claimed to be Republican how he felt and he said that he was sad but that "it is what it is..." I wish I could find him and ask him how he really feels...</body>

 <body>I'll try to answer the question the way my good friend who is a black republican that voted for mccain answered.  In her own words, the discomfort of having an unqualified President far outweighs the cultural achievment of America having elected the first black President. She also said the fact that American's are making such a huge deal about his race only makes her less impressed with the accomplishment.  She said when we have a black President that isn't constantly refered to as the First Black President then they will be more pride in the accomplishment.</body>

 <body>  When McCain 2008 turned out to be a shadow of McCain 2004 AND his pick Sarah Palin. Some of Obama's policy ideas appeal to me and the way he ran his campaign showed REAL LEADERSHIP</body>
