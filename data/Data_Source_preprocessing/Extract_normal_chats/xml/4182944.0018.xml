 <body>  I know that about Sean Penn, that what makes his films a joy to see, but IMO this is his best role. I love the way he brings the character to life, he makes you give a sense of feel for the character.  I know this will probably sound over-rating but honestly i don't care.  Sean Penn's role as Sam can nearly only be recgonised to as Heath's portrayal as The Joker. Even though they are different characters, yes that i know but both actors brought the characters to life</body>
