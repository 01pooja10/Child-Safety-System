      <body> He is not a lump of wood...Walker is a lump of wood!...I think McConnaughey appeals to men and women...he's a likeabe character...what films have you not like dhim in? His hair is fake...he was balding a few years back, now it has seemed to magically re-appeared...</body>

      <body>  What movies has he been in? That's pretty much your answer. Paul Walker is an insignificant piece of bark.</body>

      <body> I suggest porn. The acting and story are on par with anything those two have made, but with porn at least you end up with some satisfaction.</body>

      <body> Let's see: Matt has been in: How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days...cute rom-com A Time to Kill...pretty good Grisham adaptation, maybe the best one...solid movie is just to see Sam Jackson's performance Frailty...pretty good movie We Are Marshall...very under-rated well, that's about all I've liked him in, which is much more than a Paul Walker list</body>
