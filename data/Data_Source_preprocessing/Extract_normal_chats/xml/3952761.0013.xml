 <body>  Yeah, and there are a lot of problems associated with that. I pretty much know how to eliminate it, but people think that'll never work.</body>

 <body>Okay... uhhh... I made no mention of free markets... I said their government moved more and mroe to the left... they instituted welfare programs, increased taxes, increased the size of the central government and so on. Productivity sank greatly... their economy suffered to an extreme extent... couple that with a military being spread so thin - and the barbarians had their way with them.  Oh and they debased the shit out of their currency.  Now how is everything I said ehre in any disagreement with what I said earlier?  Tyler, stop contributing your straw-man arguments to discussions in this forum - it's just annoying.</body>
