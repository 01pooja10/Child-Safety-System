      <body>  The problem with using popular voting as a definitive method of making decisions about representatives. . .is that the popular vote is VERY easy to f*ck with. Given the motivation, it's really simple for someone to submit dozens of ballots using a falsified identity with each one. Since it's effectively illegal to make people provide identification when voting(and I agree with this, btw), it's makes for very skewed elections. Of course, that might not happen every time. . .but why take the risk?  I'm not saying that I agree with the Electoral College, either, since it has its own flaws. A new system should be created that does a better job at giving people a say in their government, and in the selection of representatives.</body>

      <body>I completely agree! It's not something I hear many people complain about though. Considering electors are theoretically free to vote for the candidate of their choice, which means our vote might not count at all.</body>

      <body>By all means if you don't feel like voting don't do it. I believe a big part of the reason this countries gone to shit is because uninformed people with little interest in politics vote because they feel they have a patriotic duty to do so.</body>
