 <body>   I like Superman movies to an extent, until they introduce comic relief. But going off what ERN said. They're real heros (Batman and Iron Man). Real human beings (not aliens from another world) that made themselves, their suits, their weapons, etc. etc. etc. That's pretty cool in a story sense. I found myself feeling like a kid again when I watched Iron Man as Tony Stark built his rocket flying ship (suit). "MAN THAT WOULD BE COOL TO FLY LIKE THAT!" :) is one thought I had :)</body>

 <body>While I don't disagree the pics are nice, being sexy isn't all about looks. It's the attitude of knowing who you are, knowing that you're worth being known, being confident without cockiness. The way you carry yourself. It's about having a sense of humor and being able to laugh at yourself. Taking things in stride as they come....add all those together and the over all package improves tremendously!!</body>
