 <body>  Her argument is very bogus. How can one not make a big deal about him being the first black president. She is only saying this because he is not republican or conservative. If it had been Colin Powell (who was being heavily recruited) would she be more impressed? But the media would still make a big deal of his race, because it is historic, regardless of what Party the person comes from....I always laugh when people say they want us to live in a color-blind society: the fact is that people do see color, the question is can you be mature enough to not let it cloud your judgment? The fact that race did not play a huge fact in this election is testament to how far we have come....</body>

 <body>  Interesting. I think Palin hurt McCain a little bit and it was sad to see McCain pander to the base of his party, but I think more than anything else it was the failures of George W. Bush that got Obama elected..</body>

 <body>   I seriously doubt Barack X will do anything "GREAT".  His election will only be "HISTORIC" cause hes black.  and this thread proves it.</body>

 <body>   This was a conversation we had about a month ago, and I haven't talked to her since the results were official, but I would image her opinion is still the same.  We were in a mall and this guy stopped us (i was her and a white guy that had an obama shirt on) and he asked us what basically the same question you did, and that's how you answered.  I didn't want to debate her in the mall so I didn't say anything, but I think there obviously is a cultural significance, but I don't know if its a Jackie Robinson type of accomplishment. His accomplishment was ending the ban on black players. Obama isn't breaking down a legal barrier, but it is a social barrier.  IDK, I'm more looking forward to the change he'll bring than his color though.</body>

 <body>  Why did you stop with Barack X? You forgot the Barack Hussein Obama. I cannot get over thehuge irony that here we are in a war with Islamo-fascists and we elect a president named Barack Hussein Obama. hahahahaha. I love it...</body>

 <body>   but race did play a huge part in this election for a lot of people (whether it be for positive or negative reasons). i understand his friend's mentality.  it will definitely be historical and it is certainly something to be proud of, but it was not the first step and it should not be the last.  the real accomplishment will be the day that an african-american, female, asian, gay, atheist, muslim, (ect) president is not considered a change.  this wouldn't mean we are color-blind, it would mean we are finally accepting.</body>

 <body>   Racists often do.  Im not confused. Hes no MLK wannabe, hes a Malcolm X wannabe.  Thats why jesse wanted to cut his nuts off.  Thats why his spiritual mentor, quotes Malcolm X, and hangs out with Louis Farrakahn.  Hes no christian.</body>

 <body>    I agree that race should not play a role. I voted for McCain not because of race, so don't act like people who didn't vote for Barack are not mature enough. I have heard two of my best friends (african americans) tell me they were voting for Barack because he is black. Is that not racist? Could I say I voted for McCain because he is white?? We got in many arguements about this but still remain friends because we dont spew hate at each other but intellectual differences. We definately not living in color blind society. Hell I just got done listening to Al Sharpton continue to live in a race based society. He is not savior on black issues, but a problem. My friends even said that Al Sharpton does not speak for them and shouldn't speak for every african american.</body>

 <body>  Well, you are entitled to your opinion. But need I remind you, your argument assumes that all Christians are saints and all Muslims are demons, and that in of itself is not true..</body>
