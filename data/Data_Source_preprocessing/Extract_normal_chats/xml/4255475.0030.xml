 <body>  You come off as a jerk because you said that you're glad Heath's dead because you didn't like his performance in The Dark Knight. It's ok if you didn't like the movie or Heath's performance, but to say that you're glad he's dead is what makes someone say you have a low IQ.</body>

 <body>  I'd say fully emerging yourself into a character that has serious mental issues is a lot more traumatizing than playing a character that has a homosexual relationship.</body>

 <body> I saw some interview with Nicholson when Ledger died...he said he had warned him about the character...or something like that...I think if you get that run down by a character, you are a kook to begin with...and maybe should lay off the narcotics</body>
