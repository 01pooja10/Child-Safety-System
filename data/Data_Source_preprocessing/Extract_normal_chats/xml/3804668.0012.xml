 <body>  Did i say anyone was prejudiced? Did that word come out of my mouth? Hell the teachers were probably black too....  Anyway...the school is named Martin Luther King Elementary, its common knowledge that schools in black neighborhoods are almost universally named after black leaders.</body>

 <body>  You're right -- the students would benefit from learning about right from wrong. False accusations are wrong.Â  Accusations based on circumstance with no proof are wrong.Â  Taking the authority of law into your own hands is wrong.Â  You think they got those lessons?  Most schools have a policy regard handling of cash.Â  I'd guess it was a violation of the policy to keep the money (no matter how small the amount) in an unsecured location at the school.  It could have been another teacher, a janitor or any other adult to take the money -- it could have even been mistakenly mixed up with other papers or thrown out (have you ever seen a teacher's desk in the middle of the day?)  In the public climate that exists regarding 'touching' students these days Im amazed that any educator would even go there.</body>
