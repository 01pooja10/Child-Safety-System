      <body>This isn't even debatable anymore. The ARMED FORCES JOURNAL (the bunch of pansy, pacifist liberals that they are) argued that waterboarding = torture some time ago.  http://www.armedforcesjournal.com/2007/12/3230108  TO RUDY GIULIANI AND ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE MICHAEL MUKASEY For their tacit support of waterboarding. In an interview, Giuliani was asked for his views on using Ã¢â&#130;¬Å&#147;enhanced interrogation techniques,Ã¢â&#130;¬ including waterboarding. He responded that in a hypothetical scenario that assumed an attack, Ã¢â&#130;¬Å&#147;I would tell the people who had to do the interrogation to use every method they can think of.Ã¢â&#130;¬ Prompted again on the specific use of waterboarding, he repeated Ã¢â&#130;¬Å&#147;every method they could think of.Ã¢â&#130;¬ Mukasey said he found waterboarding to be Ã¢â&#130;¬Å&#147;repugnant,Ã¢â&#130;¬ but he wouldnÃ¢â&#130;¬â&#132;¢t answer whether it amounted to torture.  Let AFJ be crystal clear on a subject where these men are opaque: Waterboarding is a torture technique that has its history rooted in the Spanish Inquisition. In 1947, the U.S. prosecuted a Japanese military officer for carrying out a form of waterboarding on a U.S. civilian during World War II.  Waterboarding inflicts on its victims the terror of imminent death. And as with all torture techniques, it is, therefore, an inherently flawed method for gaining reliable information. In short, it doesnÃ¢â&#130;¬â&#132;¢t work. That blunt truth means all U.S. leaders, present and future, should be clear on the issue.</body>
