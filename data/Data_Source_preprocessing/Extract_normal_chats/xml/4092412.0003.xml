 <body>One of the best shocker film IMO  This film is disturbingly spectacular and one of the best revenge film ever.  Kill Bill eat your heart out :)   Was it the uncut version why they shove the broken bottle in her erm erm you know what during the rape scene? Ouch that scene was gruesome....This film is technically a lesson to men...  Lesson being Don't fuck with a woman otherwise, she'll cut your balls off in the bath :)</body>

 <body>  The film is brilliant, i watch it on horror channel, i'm still waiting to get it and find it cheap on DVD, 15 pound is way too much. But trust me this film will make you look at women in a different light lol.   Another few great recommendations for horror from the 1980s  The Burning Silent Night, Deadly Night  I'm Downloading them currently</body>

 <body>Meh  Netflix will definately have them   Or just download Utorrent and find the films via torrent and watch them on the good old compy or put them on DVD :)   That's what i'm gonna do with the one i'm Downloading, because i cant find them over here and plus side one of them ain't even on DVD release, which is Silent Night Deadly Night 3.  Juss download and burn to dvd :)</body>

 <body>  I suppose that would be true if you're a rapist. Us norms already know women are nuts.</body>
