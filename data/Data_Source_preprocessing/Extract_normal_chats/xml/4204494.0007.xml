      <body> most likely no, if you had to ask...Why the hate for Matt...Okay, I think it's that damned drawl he's got...He says, "Darlin" and my toes curl...</body>

      <body> He is not a lump of wood...Walker is a lump of wood!...I think McConnaughey appeals to men and women...he's a likeabe character...what films have you not like dhim in? His hair is fake...he was balding a few years back, now it has seemed to magically re-appeared...</body>

      <body>  What movies has he been in? That's pretty much your answer. Paul Walker is an insignificant piece of bark.</body>

      <body> I suggest porn. The acting and story are on par with anything those two have made, but with porn at least you end up with some satisfaction.</body>
