 <body> You mean a good lawyer, right?  I got my older brother. He's an attorney. Although it would have to deal with real estate. Otherwise, I'm fucked.</body>

 <body> Not yet. But as an educator, I keep my fingers crossed. We're too sue-happy. I love when parents threaten to sue you if you fail their kid who never did homework and always ditches class.</body>

 <body>  In general, ÃÂ I completely disagree. ÃÂ Yes, there are those who are new and doing it for the experience, and there are those who are doing it because they have to and really donÃ¢â¬â¢t care because they are getting far less for representing someone under the Public Defenders arrangement that they would from a paying customer.ÃÂ  But there are also those who are doing it because they have a desire to see that everyone is defended. ÃÂ  I was on a murder jury where the defendant was defended by the Public Defenders office.ÃÂ  These guys threw their hearts and souls into the defense.ÃÂ  Too bad the guy was guilty as hell, but they mounted several appeals after the conviction, interviewed every member of the jury that would talk to them, and I understand that they are still trying to get this dude out.ÃÂ  I contrast that to a lawyer I had, gave him a large retainer, and he withdrew from the case after he had spent it all, much more, and I asked him to put me on a payment plan.</body>

 <body>It's the system that is at fault here. Even if they come forward, there's a good chance it wouldn't have made a difference. Having said that, however, had it been me, I would have went to the judge and DA and told what I know and given up the license. At least, maybe, the verdict could have been overturned. Only maybe, but worth a shot. Even if they didn't give up their client, just said that someone else confessed to the crime. What I don't get is why they didn't do it after their client got convicted. He was done for anyway.</body>
