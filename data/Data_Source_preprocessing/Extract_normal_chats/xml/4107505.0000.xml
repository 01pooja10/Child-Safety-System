      <body>Now mexico wants to control our laws? Either mexico should keep their people on their side or their leaders should be assassinated! Damn, I hate that country!   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico - Mexico is protesting the execution of one of its citizens in Texas despite a world court ruling for a new hearing, expressing concern for the rights of other Mexicans detained in the United States.  Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said it sent a note of protest to the State Department about Jose Medellin's case, which drew international attention because of allegations that Medellin wasn't allowed to consult the Mexican consulate for legal help following his arrest.  Texas executed Medellin, 33, late Tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in Houston.  Medellin was convicted of participating in the gang rape, beating and strangling of Elizabeth Pena, 16, and Jennifer Ertman, 14. Prosecutors said he and five fellow gang members attacked the girls as they were walking home on a June night, raped and tortured them for an hour, then kicked and stomped them before using a belt and shoelaces to strangle them.  "I'm sorry my actions caused you pain. I hope this brings you the closure that you seek. Never harbor hate," Medellin said to those gathered to watch him die. "Never harbor hate."  In Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, where Medellin was born, a small group of his relatives condemned the execution.  "This is another murder because no one has the right to take someone else's life, only God," said Medellin's cousin Reyna Armendariz.  A large black bow and a banner that read "No to the death penalty ... may God forgive you," hung from an iron fence in the front of the house where Medellin lived before moving to the United States at the age of 3.  Armendariz said the family hopes Medellin's body would be return to Mexico.  "He signed a paper saying he wanted his remains to go to a friend. Who knows if they will bring him here," Armendariz said sobbing.  The Mexican government statement said officials "were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country."  An international court ruled in 2004 that the convictions of Medellin and 50 other Mexicans on death row around the United States violated the Vienna Convention, which calls for people arrested abroad to have access to their home country's consular officials.  Texas state officials say Medellin didn't ask to do so until well after he was convicted of capital murder.  The International Court of Justice, also known as the world court, said the Mexican prisoners should have new court hearings to determine whether the violation affected their cases.  President Bush asked states to review the cases, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this year neither the president nor the international court can force Texas to wait.</body>

      <body>  I think the precedent is obvious. Don't do capital crime. It's not that hard to understand.</body>

      <body>I read that story this morning.... I might, just might, understand if the accused had been here a short time, but this fella came to America when he was 3, has been here 30 years. I'm quite sure, he does not need a Mexican consulate explaining to him our laws.</body>

      <body>That piece of filth got what he deserved! All these far-lefft loons have gone crazy, they care more about the killer than about the victim. They will never remember the two girls he raped and killed.</body>

      <body>I don't know what disgusts me more...  The fact that the bastard raped those two girls, the fact that he hypocritcally preached against hatred (he deserved it for what he did to those poor girls), or the fact that the Mexican government is basically endorsing his crimes.  Hear me illegal aliens, look, if you're so determined why don't you overthrow the assholes in charge of Mexico and make it a better place to live? Or do you condone these heinous actions yourself?  Seriously anyone who defends these bastards should themselves be put in jail. He is just lucky I wasn't there. He meaning both the rapist and the government official.</body>

      <body>"nobody has the right to take another..."  He took TWO lives! TWO! And here he is saying that his cousin is worth more than the two girls he strangled and violated?  Sorry the statement of the cousin just pissed me off enough to warrant its own rant.</body>

      <body>"Texas executed Medellin, 33, late Tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in Houston."  "The Mexican government statement said officials 'were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.' "  A couple of points: 1) why did it take 15 years to off this pond scum?Â  2) If Mexico is soooooooooooooo concerned about the treatment of their citizens in the USA, why don't they stop encouraging them to come here?</body>

      <body>  I'd also like to point out that government execution is not a matter of one man deciding to take the life of another man. It is by the LAW that this waste of space was executed.Â  The LAW DOES have the right.</body>

      <body>Everyone seems to be missing the point here. By deliberately renouncing the Vienna Convention, U.S. citizens abroad no longer have a right to request consular assistance. The world is fully cognoscente that the word of the United States on an international treaty is now worthless.</body>
