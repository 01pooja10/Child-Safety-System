      <body>  From the closing paragraph:  "Once we have absorbed and understood the fact of Jewish media control, it is our inescapable responsibility to do whatever is necessary to break that control."  Their emphasis, not mine.  What's that all about?</body>

      <body>   Pretty simple. We as Americans need to take back our country from Zionist Israel.</body>

      <body>  Do you think you can make a valid case for that without posting links to sophomoric literature that's used to fool an bunch of stupid skinheads?</body>

      <body>   It would take me days to gather the information required to explain everything within the websites I've posted. Believe me, it's only a fraction of what you're not learning from the mainstream media. I gave you a jump start on things I consider to be of importance and now it's your turn to do research.  I never said I was smarter than anyone. I just don't have my head in the sand pretending all is well with this country. While you're researching check out the NAU, or the North American Union and PNAC (Project For A New American Century).  Bye now.</body>

      <body>   Oh gawd, another f**king southern red neck...I guess your daddy was the grand pooh-ba dragon of the KKK. Take your country back, now that's a joke, Israel is the US's pit stop in the ME, why do you think they support them? Duh...</body>

      <body>  Get a grip!  I'm from Annapolis, MD and have many past and present high level NSA relatives. I know a lot of things you couldn't even imagine!  You say Israel is the US's pit stop to the Middle East. HA! Israel is the REASON the Middle East hates us so much. Israel is one of THE WORST TERRORIST... if not THE WORST... nations in the world. Look what they've done to the Palestinians. But the Zionist controlled media spins it as if Palestine is the bad guy and Israel is wonderful. Get your head out of your ass and learn the truth.</body>
