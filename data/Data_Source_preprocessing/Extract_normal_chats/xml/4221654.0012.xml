 <body> Question:  Did you lend to people without down payments by issuing ARMS? Why did you do it? Did their income match up to what they could traditionally afford?</body>

 <body>Ok, I read the whole article. The most I saw was that as of 2006 Fannie and Freddie had gone from holding 56% to 24% of subprime loans. Thats a reduction yes, but in portfolio terms that is still a HUGE amount weighted toward a risky asset.  The bundled mortgage securities that fannie and freddie offer were seen as minimal risk investments and the fact that 24% of there holdings were in the subprime market sounds downright ludicrous to me.  However, maybe i missed something in the article saying that they only held a small percentage of these loans. can you point me to it?</body>

 <body>  I'm not a mortgage lender but if I was an unethical lender I would write you a zero down ARM with a great teaser rate just to get you into the mortgage because I know I can sell this arm loan off to Fannie and Freddie and I don't have to eat it when you default.  I didn't really care what your income was, is, or could be because my profit is coming when I sell the mortgage off.  Essentially, my risk is minimal because it is assumed by Fannie and Freddie. I make easy profits because I do not have to keep bad mortgages on my books.</body>

 <body>  Subprime lending was at its height from 2004 to 2006 (hint: this was where the problem lies) - at the height of this, 84% of these bad loans were not made by Fannie and Freddie. Pretty simple math my man.</body>

 <body> Gotcha. I would like to sit down and talk with a lender who has done that. I would like to know their thought process and see if they really thought they were helping low-income families afford a home or if they knew it would all blow up, but hoping they would be off the ship before the family defaulted.</body>

 <body>Have you not read what I have been writing.  Just because 84% of these bad loans were not made by Fannie or Freddie does not mean that Fannie or Freddie did not come to own these loans.  The problem is NOT where the loan originated but the problem IS where the mortgage ended up. These loans were made in the private sector and then came to be owned by Fannie and Freddie.</body>

 <body>  You need to show that they did in order for me to be concerned... I don't jump to conclusions without evidence.</body>

 <body>well from your article  "Fannie, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., don't lend money, to minorities or anyone else, however. They purchase loans from the private lenders who actually underwrite the loans."  -like I've been saying.  combine that with:  "Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent"  -which i earlier explained is a huge amount of risky debt to hold. Especially if you're bundling all these mortgages together and selling them off as bonds. Fannie and Freddie were whats known as GSE's (government sponsored enterprise). A problem with GSE's is that many investors like AIG, Lehman Brothers, China, banks, etc. view debt issued by GSE's as risk free because they think the government wont allow the debt to default. Essentially, GSE debt ended up being viewed as Treasury debt with higher return and the same risk. Turns out that wasn't the case now all this debt issued by GSE's has questionable value and its making everything go to shit.  In the end it looks like your article was written by somebody who doesn't know how this whole system works.</body>
