      <body> I don't see how that's possible, considering that Bush caused 9/11. Josh would never do that.</body>

      <body>I absolutely do not think that. It was the use of the word liberal as an insult. But I've already adressed that in another thread.</body>

      <body>Did Josh study history books of Ulysses S. Grant and Warren G. Harding like W did on the subject of "unbelievably inept and abominable attempts of some men to completely f*ck up an entire nation as president" ?</body>

      <body>   No. And the word you should have used was independent. 'liberal' is a word for people who don't know who or why or what they're so angry for.</body>

      <body>  Hey, whadaya mean, f*ck up an entire nation? He's just living the american dream! You know, financing two wars with credit cards from china! For as much as has been spent in the wars, is how much the US will have to pay back to china, plus interest. This isn't pinko liberal faggity talk. This is money talk. Some dumbass who got the pulitzer prize in economics wrote a book saying this war is going to cost at least 3 trillion dollars (trillion is a word liberals like to use, 3 syllables). anyway, china will own the US, and bush still doesn't own Iraq, and the US soldiers who don't own their arms or legs or brains will be cared for, until they die, and that bill hasn't even started to come in yet. Wow, sounds like this could be a very interesting movie! Can't wait! I wonder if it will be as sick as the real thing.</body>
