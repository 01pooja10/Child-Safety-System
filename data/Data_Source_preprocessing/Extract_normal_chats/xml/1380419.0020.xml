 <body>I was trying to figure out the title for a long time, and finally got a decent explaination. Apparently it's a close reference to the UK slang for a slot machine. They call em' fruit machines (I just heard it used the other day in an Arctic Monkey's song!) and the fact it has inner workings like a clock. Alex feels life is a gamble, etc etc.  Any other theories?</body>
