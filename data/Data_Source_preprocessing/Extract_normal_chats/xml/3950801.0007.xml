 <body>  And I'm sure al-Sadr loves to bathe in the blood of the slain!  Seriously, it would be in everyone's best interest if the Iraqis were just left to their own devices.</body>

 <body>  Yes to some Iraqis, we may be terrorists and to some Iraqis we may not be. Who are you to decide that all Iraqis don't want us there? There must be some who are glad we got rid of Sadam . *This is not my personal oppinion, just common sense*  And you really don't need to swear. You keep on blabbing how you report people for saying the word "idiot" when you clearly say the F word. Twice. So I guess I should just report you for your dirty language. Hmm??  Nobody asked you to give a "s..." about us Americans. We don't need your "give a s." We have eachother, our pride, stability, and optimism. Who cares what in the world you think?  All our current government cares for is oil. All our future government will care about is God willing, Americans.  And also, those places are "s" holes to you, you probley have not visited them, thus you have no basis to call them "s" holes because you have no grounds to do so.  Andddd our country is not "f" up. Thats just what you think. And I'm sure most people could care less about wht you think when all you think is dirty words.</body>

 <body>  My claims? You, you Y-O-U.ÃÂ  are the one who has claimed all this stuff,  "America is "f" up. "America is a terrorist" "All America cares for is Israel and KSA" (+ all the swearing included) "Iraqis dislike Americans" ( I said some, you said who am I to judge, which can be inferred as you think all)  I'm just countering what you say. SoÃÂ whatever. I'll just leave to you spew more swear words.</body>

 <body> Lisa:  We have been in Germany and Japan for 63 years, Korea for 58.  Do you support Obama whose foreign policy advisors are like a remake of Jimmy VCarters (except for Brezinzki who was Carter's adviosr?ÃÂ  then there is Powers, Mulloy (who resigned after it became public that he had been meeting with Hamas) and retired General Merril McPeake who blames Israel for the lack of peace.</body>
