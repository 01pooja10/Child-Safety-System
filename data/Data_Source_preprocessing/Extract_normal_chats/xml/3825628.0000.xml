 <body>Fallon 'may lose job over Iran war'  Adm.William Fallon, the head of the US Central Command, may lose his jobfor opposing President Bush's plans to wage war against Iran. According to a new Esquirearticle by Thomas Barnett; Admiral Fallon may be prematurely 'relievedof his command' as soon as this summer to be replaced with a more'pliable' commander.  "If that were to happen, it maywell mean that the president and vice-president intend to take militaryaction against Iran before the end of this year and don't want acommander standing in their way," says the article which will bepublished on March 12.  Admiral Fallon, who has beennamed as 'one of the best strategic thinkers in uniform today' byDefense Secretary Robert Gates, opposed the troops surge in Iraq andhas consistently battled with President George W. Bush to avertconfrontation with Iran.  The Navy admiral has vowed thatan attack on Iran would 'not happen on his watch', calling the WhiteHouse warmongering echelons 'not helpful'.  Washington and its allies are at loggerheads with the Islamic Republic over the country's nuclear standoff with the West.  TheBush administration accuses Iran of pursuing nuclear weaponry, whileTehran maintains its uranium enrichment will only provide fuel for thecountry's under-construction nuclear power plants.  PresidentBush insists the military option against Iran remains on the table,while his top military experts, including Admiral Fallon, urge theWhite House to choose a diplomatic approach towards Tehran.  In a Thursday White House press briefing, spokeswoman Dana Perino was asked about the Esquire piece and refused to confirm whether Fallon's position is secure until the end of his tenure.</body>

 <body>I guess he's too liberal for them, like Peter Pace, whose term - one of the shortest in history - as chairman of the joint chiefs, ended soon after he argued that evidence of Iranian military hardware in Iraq is not evidence of their state sanction, at least not at the highest levels. that apparently, didn't go over well at the neocon nerve center (pentagon).</body>

 <body>they don't like to be contradicted. that's been clear since day 1 and is probably why 9/11 happened as well...due to their stubborness and idiocy.  fallon may well be, as one of the articles below delves into, the only man standing between us and full out world war.

 <body>In his statement, Fallon said: "Recent press reports suggesting a disconnect between my views and the President's policy objectives have become distraction at a critical time and hamper efforts in the Centcom region."  "And although I don't believe there have ever been any differences about the objectives of our policy in the Central Command Area of Responsibility, the simple perception that there is makes it difficult for me to effectively serve America's interests there," he said.</body>
