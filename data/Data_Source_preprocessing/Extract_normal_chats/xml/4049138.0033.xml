 <body> The only thing good about the ending to Citizen Kane is that it ended: boring. The credits are the highlight of the film.</body>

 <body>  Oh right, was that why it became the most acclaimed film of all time? Actually Citizen Kane is a brilliant film, it was highly influential, it was a landmark in filmmaking, it practically changed the way films are made, Orson Welles created a certain cinematography in the film that is revolutionary</body>

 <body>Hm...I don't really pay attention to which endings I like best, but I must say I like the ending to the movie Wanted. I saw it yesterday. Actually, the whole movie was pretty good. IT was kind of confusing at time sbecause of the flashbacks and all, but I'd say it's better than a lot of the films that has been ocming out lately.</body>
