 <body>Probably if you stole 5 bucks worth of candy from Wal-Mart they would just make you pay out of pocket and not strip you down.</body>

 <body>  Wow.Â  Really you would just say, go ahead and violate my rights?Â  So if a cop pulls you over and ask you to let him search you car, will you let him?Â  Or a cop comes to your home and asks to search your home will you let him?Â  I mean he has no reason to and no warrant.Â  You would still let him because he is doing his job?  I would wait for the warrant.Â  Especially when I know I am innocent.Â  I am just in shock by your statement.Â  I cannot believe you do not value your rights.  Maybe you were joking.Â  Were you?</body>

 <body>If I were the teacher, I would tell them I just created a MASSIVE project for them out of thin air. Anyone who tells me who took the money gets an automatic 100 and doesn't have to do it.</body>
