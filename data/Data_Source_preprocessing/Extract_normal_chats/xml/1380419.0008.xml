 <body>Friggin awesome flick. Loved The Shining too. And even though the story was kinda boring, Barry Lyndon was a gorgeous flick. First half of Full Metal Jacket was cool too.</body>

 <body>It's an incredible film. Stanley Kubrick is surely one of the greatest filmmakers of all-time. I would place him above Welles, Godard, Dreyer, Bergman, Fellini and Bunuel, and that's saying quite a bit.</body>

 <body>Stanley Kubrick, and seeing "Clockwork Orange" as a teenager were what made me start to study film as a potential art form, not just the Hollywood products shoved into release dates that I was used to up until that point (and that, more and more, movies tend towards now). It was just so unique and powerful, and in a way, through its own antisocial nature, it gave me the strength to get through those uncertain high school years, where I often felt caged up and institutionalized like Alex. A lot of people didn't understand it, wrote it off as too weird or disturbing (which it is, certainly was at the time, though times have changed), but then it's not meant to be a family film. I wrote like 2 papers on it in college.    Although I for one think filmmakers are far too casual with releasing Special Edition DVD versions of movies these days, there's one movie where it'd be really nice to see just that, so we might have something with promotional materials and essays and documentaries detailing its influence and transition to the screen, and with any luck, a commentary by Malcolm McDowell and Jan Harlan detailing their thoughts about it, and Kubrick himself (RIP, Stan).</body>
