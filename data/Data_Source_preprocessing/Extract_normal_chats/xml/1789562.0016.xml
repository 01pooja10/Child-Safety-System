 <body>im gonna put my vote for bale as batman, however I did prefer tim burtons direction. wish he would do another one.    I have to say i was terribly disappointed with maguire as spiderman. in my mind, from reading the comics and watching the cartoons as i grew up Peter Parker was not a whining lil dork but a confident witty and highly intelligent kid, trying to make his way day to day and putting up with hassels of his home life.    i just found it sad that intelligence was veiwed as "geekiness"</body>

 <body>    Go back and look at 1960's Spider-Man comics. That's what they're going for in the movies. And he was a geek. A skinny, brainy geek that suddenly got powers. I think Tobey nailed that.</body>
