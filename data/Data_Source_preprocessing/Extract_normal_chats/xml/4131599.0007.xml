 <body>  Who knows. Like I said, you're not going to stop these kinds of things. I do think there are more important things in the world to worry about though than incidents like this.</body>

 <body> Should airlines permanently suspend the sale of alcohol aboard domestic and international flights after this "near incident" with two "drunken wenches" who wanted "fresh air" at 30,000 feet?</body>

 <body>Acouple of clarifications here. They opened a bottle of duty free vodka and got drunk on that, not the in flight drinks. The cabin staff probably were'nt aware they were drinking until it was too late. Aircraft doors cannot open at altitude. They are sealed shut due to the pressure difference between the cabin and the outside. It's like a plug in a bathtub.</body>

 <body>  i doubt that will happen since alot of money is made off of the alcohol sold on board.  the flight attendents should just simply cut off anyone who seems too drunk</body>

 <body>  Â  They were drinking alcohol which they bought before they boarded the aeroplane . But why should sales be suspended just because of one incidentÂ ? Millions of people fly on a daily basis , or weekly anyway, and why should all the responsible drinkers be refused a drink, just because two people misbehave ?</body>
