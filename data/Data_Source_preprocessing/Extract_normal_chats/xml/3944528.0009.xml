      <body>  A good question to Obama supporters and especially the black voters. Would you support Hillary Clinton if she was chosen to be the nominee by the superdelegates?</body>

      <body>It's pretty obvious they are going to try and play up her possible win West Virginia as the "unexpected game changer", now she just has to hope she has the momentum to do so.</body>

      <body>  You haven't been around politics long, son.Â  I'm a Ron Paul supporter and I say that's within the realm of possibility--all's fair in love, war, and politics, and that kind of thing's been done before.Â  Read history and learn something.</body>

      <body>  Well that is a good example of a black voter taking control of the situation rather than being controlled by the situation. I just ask this question just in case it might turn out that way. I just hope black voters will still turn out for Hillary even though it has been a rough primary. Hillary really did not have a choice but to be on the offensive against Obama and throw the kitchen sink at him due to the fact that Obama did take her by surprise with overwhelming victories after Super Tuesday. But it is definitely in Obama's favor right now to be the nominee. Good luck to all candidate.</body>

      <body> She herself was heard to say that she could claim big momentum just by a sweep in Puerto Rico.  She's changed her metrics from popular vote to superdelegate count to Big Mo. She's desperate.</body>

      <body>She isn't in such a dire situation that she can't win especially since she's expected to win W.V. and Kentucky, it all comes down to how fast Obama can get more delegates despite it all. That's the real race going on at the moment.</body>

      <body>  Spoken like a true winner-take-all Republican. Sorry, kid, but Democrats don't work that way--their delegation is meted out proportionally.Ã&#130;Â  In Indiana, she "won" 51% to 49% so she comes out at best, a single delegate more than Obama got in Indiana.  She's gotta win by at least 70% in ALL the remaining states just to break even.Ã&#130;Â  70% ain't happening in either WV or KY.</body>

      <body>Maybe, but I'm not Republican. I was just trying to be fair to Hillary supporters. It isn't over. It's daunting, no doubt. I support Obama and think he is the best candidate and will win against McCain, just telling it like I see it.</body>

      <body>  A theory that holds as much water as the theory that Obama is a Republican mole, chosen as the perfect enemy to defeat Hillary (a charming black male vs. a bulldog white woman) back in 2004.  In other words, unlikely.</body>
