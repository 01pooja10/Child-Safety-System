 <body>He was good in 'I'm Not There', though Cate Blanchett stole the movie with her performance. I think he was a bit over rated for his actual body of work.</body>

 <body> If he hadn't died, his performance as the Joker would have been the start of something really big for him. The Dark Knight seems to have spurred many, many people who never saw a Heath Ledger movie before to go back and review his earlier work.</body>
