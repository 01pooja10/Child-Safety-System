 <body>The video is a rah rah rah for America...not much else. The breakdown is narrow sited and biased. The point that should be between the lines are the lines.  As to Rome, does anyone else give creedence to the theory that the lead in the aquaducts lead to a gradual dumbing down of the Roman population in general? Can't recall where I heard it, but it always struck me as an interesting thought.</body>

 <body>What does the Roman Empire have to do with the United States?  So what if they were a republic and they failed? That doesn't mean the US ever will. That's just a stupid argument. That's like saying . . . "oh, Tommy went to college and failed all of his classes, and since Tommy failed, you are doomed to failure too"! Dumb dumb dumb.</body>

 <body> America won't be on top forever Nichols. It might not crash and burn, but it will fade into the background in time. Nothing lasts forever.  As far as Rome goes, its the first thing to jump out at alot of people when they hear the words "empire" or "republic." We could try comparisons to the Ottomans, but it wouldn't reach as broad an audience.</body>

 <body>  The reason they compared it to the US is because the Romans had about the same system of government a Republic. Less government, less taxes, the people were free. Later on the Roman politicians started asking for more people and more government bigger government, more taxes, spreading their empire. This caused a collapse of their economy and the Empire broke down. This is what happened to the United States and it might come crashing down just like the Roman Empire.</body>

 <body> No, I know why they compared it, but my point was that just because one thing fails, doesn't mean the other will.</body>
