 <body>  It's the 'healers' fault if the healer guarantees results, which they often do. In the doctor case, then, yes, they are sued for malpractice. And no doctor will guarentee results. And, while the scientific community often makes mistakes, they do have that whole scientific method thingy. If a doctor lies to you, yes, he's held accountable. A faith healer will lie to you when they say "my system brings results".</body>

 <body>  I agree here, absolutely. As long as the faith healer, aromatic therapist, etc gives you all the information so you can make the best choice.</body>
