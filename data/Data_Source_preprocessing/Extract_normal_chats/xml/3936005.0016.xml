      <body>Hollywood is seeing the Bollywood effect at the moment. The architect about how a movie comes to be made has changed drastically in Hollywood over the last decade. Churn out lots of movies and they only have to be ok in quality. Turn a modest profit at the box office because the B.O. is now a secondary revenue stream to the direct sell-through DVD, PPV, Foreign Distribution and cable TV markets.  Hollywood used to be a talent based industry -- Audiences would go see movies for the talent (actors; directors) even more than they do now. However, now it is a packaged goods industry on the studio side where talent takes a back seat to the movie itself (the high concept), and why marketing the movie is more important than anything else. A movie's main theatrical run is now just a 110 minute commercial for the eventual DVD release where it can make 10x its B.O. take.  Teens still go to the movies each weekend which throws a whole other dimension into the mix and is why most of the products offered cater to this demographic.  So... How does this explain movies just being not as good as the ones in previous years from a strictly business perspective?  The emphasis isn't on quality anymore. It's on quantity.  There will be 100 movies, big and small, coming out this summer of 2008. That's just a four month period (May-August). Consider how many movies come out PER YEAR (in the U.S.) and this is proof the focus is now on market saturation and not the quality of the product. Also, consider over half (50%) of those movies released each year are remakes and or based on previously proven properties like novels and comic books.  Studios can get away with this approach because a lot of these movies aren't made for very much, so when they do strike B.O. gold -- Like "Juno" -- They can maximize the profits.  Most of your smaller movies have budgets of less than $40 million which is why they can afford to fail at the B.O. because they will easily make that back through DVD rentals. These days, there are only a few, tent pole pictures studios are willing to sink a lot of money ($100-$300 million per picture) into. These are your franchise pictures like the household comic book movies, high concept stuff like "Transformers" etc. -- Properties that coincidentally also have cross-promotional tie-ins (toys, video games, fast food, cell phone, etc.) to help finance the films.  It is this emphasis on quantity that is effecting what is produced, movies don't have to be "good" anymore. They just have to be on the market and interest you in the DVD. Because once you buy or rent the DVD, even if the movie "sucks" you've already spent your money and that is what the studios and theater owners want.  But to say all movies are garbage this decade is pure idiocy. This decade has seen many future classics in their respected genres...from all around the world.</body>

      <body>In total...From a studio standpoint it's much easier to go with a sure thing and proven commodities/formulas than to risk allot of money an a "personal original film" from an artist(which can take years to create and make).</body>

      <body>  True but its still early for Avatar but i do reckon by Christmas this year Cameron will definately send us a present to hold us until Dec 2009.  I mean the Viral marketing for The Dark Knight didn't begin until a year before it was due release to hit Cinema, when we saw that beautiful teaser revealing Ledger voice and laugh.</body>

      <body>Yes, a lot of new movies are garbage. A lot of old movies are also garbage. There has always been garbage and there will always be garbage. Still, some really good movies are being made. It's just that most people don't bother to go see them. Because they are FOREIGN. *shocking* That said, a lot of foreign films are also garbage. :lol:</body>

      <body>Because they are trying to sell tickets. Crap sells just as good as quality. Not as many, mind you if the project sucks, but it sells. In this corner we have Iron Man. In the other corner we have Never Back Down. Movies are not about artistic expression or character development and a good plot. It's about making whatever it is PG-13 so kids with money can go see it alone and spend that money on tickets.</body>
