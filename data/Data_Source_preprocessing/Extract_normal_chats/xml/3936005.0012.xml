      <body>Define new?  2007 was one of the strongest years in recent memory.  2008 is off to a weak start.  Both of those have something to do with the writers strike, I think.  And yes, expand the horizons and stop watching what Hollywood wants you to watch. Also, while you're at it, turn off your FM radios and delete your MTVs. You'll thank me later.  Garbage does rock though...</body>

      <body> No, it's just because we the movie goers don't care to see originals therefore they don't get released everywhere, nor during the summer..  Box office shows that we prefer popcorn movies over movies that are really good like say, No Country for Old men, There will be blood, those movie didn't do a fraction of what that mess called Spider-man 3 did..  And like i said, we will just see how many of you that keep screaming for something original in hollywood, that will head out to watch The Strangers May 30th.. in fact how many of you have even bothered to rent The Orphanage?</body>

      <body>  Saw it at the theater... But it's not a Hollywood picture.  Which backs up my point, there were a LOT of good films released in 2007, it's up to you to track them down.</body>

      <body>Hollywood is seeing the Bollywood effect at the moment. The architect about how a movie comes to be made has changed drastically in Hollywood over the last decade. Churn out lots of movies and they only have to be ok in quality. Turn a modest profit at the box office because the B.O. is now a secondary revenue stream to the direct sell-through DVD, PPV, Foreign Distribution and cable TV markets.  Hollywood used to be a talent based industry -- Audiences would go see movies for the talent (actors; directors) even more than they do now. However, now it is a packaged goods industry on the studio side where talent takes a back seat to the movie itself (the high concept), and why marketing the movie is more important than anything else. A movie's main theatrical run is now just a 110 minute commercial for the eventual DVD release where it can make 10x its B.O. take.  Teens still go to the movies each weekend which throws a whole other dimension into the mix and is why most of the products offered cater to this demographic.  So... How does this explain movies just being not as good as the ones in previous years from a strictly business perspective?  The emphasis isn't on quality anymore. It's on quantity.  There will be 100 movies, big and small, coming out this summer of 2008. That's just a four month period (May-August). Consider how many movies come out PER YEAR (in the U.S.) and this is proof the focus is now on market saturation and not the quality of the product. Also, consider over half (50%) of those movies released each year are remakes and or based on previously proven properties like novels and comic books.  Studios can get away with this approach because a lot of these movies aren't made for very much, so when they do strike B.O. gold -- Like "Juno" -- They can maximize the profits.  Most of your smaller movies have budgets of less than $40 million which is why they can afford to fail at the B.O. because they will easily make that back through DVD rentals. These days, there are only a few, tent pole pictures studios are willing to sink a lot of money ($100-$300 million per picture) into. These are your franchise pictures like the household comic book movies, high concept stuff like "Transformers" etc. -- Properties that coincidentally also have cross-promotional tie-ins (toys, video games, fast food, cell phone, etc.) to help finance the films.  It is this emphasis on quantity that is effecting what is produced, movies don't have to be "good" anymore. They just have to be on the market and interest you in the DVD. Because once you buy or rent the DVD, even if the movie "sucks" you've already spent your money and that is what the studios and theater owners want.  But to say all movies are garbage this decade is pure idiocy. This decade has seen many future classics in their respected genres...from all around the world.</body>

      <body>In total...From a studio standpoint it's much easier to go with a sure thing and proven commodities/formulas than to risk allot of money an a "personal original film" from an artist(which can take years to create and make).</body>

      <body>  True but its still early for Avatar but i do reckon by Christmas this year Cameron will definately send us a present to hold us until Dec 2009.  I mean the Viral marketing for The Dark Knight didn't begin until a year before it was due release to hit Cinema, when we saw that beautiful teaser revealing Ledger voice and laugh.</body>
