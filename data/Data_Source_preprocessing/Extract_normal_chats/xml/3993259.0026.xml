 <body>Well, then it looks like McCain will definitely win then. And for the comment about how some countries wouldn't respect Hilary as being our president, what sheesha have you been smoking? There are third world countries that are more culturally ahead of us in respecting a woman leader. A woman president would actually help US ratings than a black president.</body>
