 <body>Women have made great strides here in the past few decades, thanks in part to the feminist movement. Women have more opportunities available to them now than they've ever had. (At least in recorded history). They are now able compete in more sports than ever before and they now have equal access to colleges and schools and to most careers. And now with equal access women are showing that they can hang and even outshine the boys. More women than men are going to college and more are graduating and starting new careers. On some campuses almost 70% of the student population is female. Women are taking on more leadership responsibilites and some tests show that women in general make better managers or leaders. Women in their twenties in most large cities in the US are actually making more money than the men in their own age group. A lot of successful women are finding it hard to find a man who makes what they make. More and more, women are actually making more than their husband of boyfriend. I do believe society has become more feminized. Just look at the news with the war in Iraq. Ever since Vietnam, people have begun to question war and the need for it. Women historically have never been in favor of war and most men are becomming that way. I believe Women are definately making a huge mark on history at this very moment and I do believe we will see more of a female influence on leadership, politics, education, etc. etc. etc. where before they never had a voice.</body>

 <body>  The person said "Finally,a teenager talking sense" or something along those lines. I hate it when people in their early 20's talk like they were kids 100 years ago.  Tea sippin' bitch? Another English sterotype. How original.  LOL.</body>
