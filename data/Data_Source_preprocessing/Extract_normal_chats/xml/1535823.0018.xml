 <body>    There isn't much debate over what events take place in what order. That's relatively easy to figure out in one viewing.    As for what is in the briefcase, I think people over think it. It doesn't really matter, it's sort of a fill in the blank for whatever is valuable to a gangster. Be that money, drugs, jewelry, or whatever. Just my opinion.</body>

 <body>I've read that the Golden/Yellow glow from the briefcase represented the color of the Oscar statue as sort of an 'in' joke amoung Hollywood insiders because everyone in the film idustries dream is to win an Academy Award.</body>

 <body>From what i know it's Marsellus Wallace's Soul.    That's why he has the bandaid on the back of his neck.  I've heard Tarantino say that.</body>

 <body>The theory I like is that it's the diamonds from Reservoir Dogs. The 'soul' theory is the most popular, I think.</body>

 <body>The truth is nothing is suppose to be in the breifcase. It's up to the viewer what is it in the case. Tarantino and Avary didn't know what to put in the case since they thought the diamonds from the heist in Reservoir Dogs wasn't original enough.    Also what religious text does it say the Devil takes the soul from the back of the neck? Rhames just had a scar on the back of his neck, and Tarantino being the perfectionist he is, didn't want the scar on screen. Hense the band-aid, and this is backed up by Tarantino himself.    The rest are just theories.</body>

 <body>For a long time I thought it was a gateway to hell, or something along those lines. But that was mostly due to the fact that the combination to the briefcase appeared to be "666" and when opened, it glowed orange/yellow/gold colors, resembling the colors of fire. That's wrong though I'm sure. I like the theory of Marcellus' soul</body>
