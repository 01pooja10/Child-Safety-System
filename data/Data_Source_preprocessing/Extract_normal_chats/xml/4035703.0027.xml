      <body>  Since Australia has banned ordinary handguns and citizens were forced to give up their guns, crime has increased.  The same will happen if the 2nd Amendment gets dropped.</body>

      <body>  That's becuase only the honest law abiding citizens will obey the law. Criminals aren't going to say "Ok, we'll not break that gun law ... but the others are fair game".Â  That's just rediculous.Â  Criminals are going to keep their guns, and get more on the black market.Â  The only thing gun-control gaurantees is that the innocent people can't deffend themselves against criminals with guns.Â  THAT is why DC's gun crime has sky-rocketted in the last 30 years under their gun-crontrol laws.  Be preaired for DC's crime rate to drop like a brick now that your averatge joe can deffend himself.</body>

      <body>  Give it 6 months to decline...  Unless the DC lawmakers do some fast rewriting and figure out how to reinstate the effect of the law...</body>

      <body>If they could manage to pull together accurate statistics, I wouldn't be surprised if it dropps off sharply after just one or two months. If I was a resident of DC, I'd go get my new gun TODAY.</body>

      <body>  It will take a couple of armed citizens dropping a couple of scum before the real effect of people having the guns will be noticed by the criminals.</body>

      <body>  Once they start getting guns into the hands of law abiding citizens, it shouldn't take long. I bet there's probably a sizeable betting pool in DC right now in regards to how quickly the first criminal will be killed by a legal gun.</body>
