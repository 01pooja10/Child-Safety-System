 <body>In his statement, Fallon said: "Recent press reports suggesting a disconnect between my views and the President's policy objectives have become distraction at a critical time and hamper efforts in the Centcom region."  "And although I don't believe there have ever been any differences about the objectives of our policy in the Central Command Area of Responsibility, the simple perception that there is makes it difficult for me to effectively serve America's interests there," he said.</body>

 <body> An Admiral Takes on the White House By Gareth Porter Go to Original Washington - A new article on CENTCOM commander Adm. William Fallonconfirms that his public statements last fall ruling out war againstIran last fall were not coordinated with the White House and landed himin trouble more than once with President George W. Bush and VicePresident Dick Cheney. In anadmiring article on Fallon in Esquire, former Pentagon official ThomasP.M. Barnett writes that Fallon angered the White House by "brazenlychallenging" Bush on his aggressive threat of war against Tehran.Barnett also cites "well-placed observers" as saying Bush may soonreplace Fallon with a "more pliable" commander. Barnett's account, which quotes conversations with Fallon during theCENTCOM commander's trips to the Middle East, shows that Fallonprivately justified his statements contradicting the Bush policy ofkeeping the "option" of an unprovoked attack on Iran "on the table" asnecessary to calm the fears of Egypt and other friendly Arab regimes ofa US-Iran war. Barnett recalls thatwhen Fallon was in Cairo in November, the lead story in that day'sedition of the English-language daily Egyptian Gazette carried theheadline "US Rules Out Strike against Iran" over a picture of Fallonmeeting with President Hosni Mubarak. That story, published Nov. 19 and not picked up by any US news media,reported that Fallon had "ruled out a possible strike against Iran andsaid Washington was mulling nonmilitary options instead." Later that day, according to Barnett, Fallon told him during a coffeebreak in a military meeting, "I'm in hot water again," and thenconfirmed that his problems were directly with the White House. That was the second time in less than a week and the third time inseven weeks that Fallon had publicly declared that there would be nowar against Iran. In an interview with Al-Jazeera television inSeptember, which Fallon himself had requested, according to a source atAl-Jazeera, he had said, "This constant drum beat of conflict is whatstrikes me which is not helpful and not useful." And only a week before the trip to Egypt, in an interview withFinancial Times, Fallon had said, a military strike was not "in theoffing," adding, "Another war is just not where we want to go." These statements represented an extraordinary exercise of power by acombat commander, because it contradicted a central feature of theBush-Cheney strategy on Iran. High-ranking Bush administrationofficials had been routinely repeating the administration's line thatno option had been taken "off the table" since early 2005. At an Oct. 17 news conference, Bush said he had "told people that ifyou're interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought tobe interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary tomake a nuclear weapon." Fallon'spublic statements explicitly ruling out an attack on Iran thusundermined the Bush administration's threat against Iran. The willingness of the top commander in the Middle East to take themilitary option "off the table" was in part a reflection of thedetermination of uniformed military leaders to prevent what theyregarded as a disastrous course. Thenew chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, whoreplaced Gen. Peter Pace in June, was even more candid about hisopposition to the use of force against Iran than Pace had been,according to a Congressional staffer who had participated in privatemeetings with both. Pace declared publicly in late October, "We have tobe mindful of the risks that would [be spawned] by engaging in a thirdconflict" in the region. Mullen added, however, that military options "cannot be taken off the table." But Fallon, as the commander responsible for the entire Middle East,was concerned about more than the consequences of actually exercisingthe military option. He was prompted to enunciate a "no-war" line onIran by the panicky reactions of Arab states to what they thought wereindications of the warlike intentions of Bush administration. In the latter half of 2007 friendly Arab regimes were upset by thepossibility of a US-Iran war, which they feared would destabilize theentire region. Fallon is quoted as telling Barnett, "[I]t's all anyonewants to talk about right now. People here hear what I'm saying andunderstand. I don't want to get them too spun up." Fallon told Barnett that his ruling out of military action against Iranwas necessary to calm the very regimes the Bush administration washoping to enlist to support its anti-Iran line. "Washington interpretsthis as all aimed at them," Fallon said in Cairo, according to Barnett."Instead, it's aimed at governments and media in this region. I'm nottalking about the White House." Fallon was arguing, in effect, that it makes no sense to make thepossibility of an unprovoked attack part of your declaratory policy ifmerely induces confusion and panic among friendly governments withoutinfluencing the target of the threat. Barnett quotes Fallon as complaining that "they" - meaning White Houseofficials - were asking him, "Why are you even meeting with Mubarak?"But Fallon strongly defended the diplomatic role he was playing inrelations with Mubarak and other Middle Eastern leaders. "This is mycenter of gravity," Fallon told him. "This is my job." Fallon's sensitivity to the political-diplomatic consequences of adeclaratory policy that explicitly keeps open the threat of anaggressive war as a potential option set him apart not only from theWhite House but from the consensus among national security specialistsin both parties. In early 2007, all three of the top three Democraticcontenders for the presidential nomination publicly declared theirsupport for keeping "all options on the table." Fallon is not the first CENTCOM commander to rein in aggressive WhiteHouse policy toward the Middle East. In late 1997, according to DanaPriest's book, The Mission, the Bill Clinton White House wanted CENTCOMcommander Gen. Anthony Zinni to order his pilots to provoke a militaryconfrontation with Iraq in the no-fly zone by deliberately drawing firefrom Iraqi planes. The request forsuch a provocation was conveyed to Zinni by the vice chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Ralston. But Zinni, who believed thatit could lead to an unwanted war with Iraq, insisted that a formalrequest from the White House would have to be sent, and the plan wasdropped. The unhappiness of the Bushadministration with Fallon's role as well as the unflattering pictureof administration policy revealed by the article was evident Thursdayfrom the failure of either the White House or the Pentagon to issue theusual reassuring statements in response to the article. The White House declined to comment, although, according to theWashington Post's Thomas Ricks, the article "was being discussedthere." The Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said Secretary ofDefense Robert M. Gates "has read the profile on Admiral Fallon butchooses not to comment on it or other press accounts."</body>

 <body>It's the "Oh Shit!" Moment on Iran  by  Dave Lindorff | March 12, 2008 - 8:18am  Everyhorrormovie has that "Oh Shit!" moment, when the hero or heroes arehuddled insome creepy hideout, and suddenly something happens thattells you thatthe monster is just around the corner, or just about toattack. In"Jurassic Park" it was the pulsing ripples in a cup ofwater, heraldingthe arrival of a T-Rex. In "Jaws" it was the deep bassmusic, lettingyou know that a monstrous shark was about to attack. Well,we justgot our "Oh Shit!" moment with the just-announced resignationof AdmiralWilliam J. Fallon, the military commander of US Middle Eastoperations. Adm.Fallon, 63, famously said that an attack onIran would not happen "on mywatch," and is widely believed to havealready threatened, along with anumber of other top generals andadmirals, to quit the service if theBush administration were to launchan air attack on Iran. Put thepieces together. We know that thevice president is obsessed with adesire to attack Iran, and has beensince before he even took office.Bush has repeatedly stressed thatIran cannot be permitted to continuewith its nuclear processing (hecalls it their "nukular" bomb program,though there is no evidence thatthe country has a nuclear bombdevelopment program, and in fact thelast National Intelligence Estimateon Iran said there was not andhadn't been since 2003). And Fallon hasnow quit. The Eisenhowernuclear aircraft carrier strike forcehas departed for stationing offIran, joining forces already in placethere, and loaded to the brimwith strike aircraft, Tomahawk missiles,and even nuclear weapons. Itwas long ago reported that stealth bombershad been put in place income of the countries of the old Soviet Unionnorth of Iran, as well ason the island of Diego Garcia in the IndianOcean. All theelements, that is to say, are in place for amassive air assault onIranian targets, designed to destroy its nuclearprogram, cripple itsmilitary command and control, and--at least this isa stated Cheneygoal--to lead to the overthrow of the Iranian governmentby its ownpeople. It is, of course, the strategy of madmen. TheUShas no forces to send into Iran. All they can do is bomb it.Andbombing a country doesn't lead its people to rise up. It leads themtorally 'round the flag. Especially when the civilian casualties ofournot-so-"smart" bombs start to soar. If such an attack weretohappen, we can kiss goodbye to six years of domestic peace, suchaswe've had. The Iranians have considerable capability to inflictdamageon US targets of interest, both overseas and here in the domesticUSusing assymetrical warfare techniques. The worse part is, they'dbecompletely justified in doing so, since any attack on them would beacrime against peace--the gravest of all international crimes. Americantroopsalready mired and pinned down in a war in Iraq, would findthemselvessuddenly under attack by Shia forces there, who for severalyears nowhave been largely leaving them alone. And oil, whichjust bumpedup against $110 a barrel, an all-time record, will doublein priceovernight, as the whole Persian Gulf becomes a war zone. Wecanexpect massive launches of small boats armed with missilesandtorpedoes, as well as sophisticated anti-ship missiles fromshorebatteries, all fired at US ships in the Gulf, and it wouldbeastounding if some or even many vessels of the US fleet weren't sunk. Meanwhile,tankertraffic in the Gulf, which accounts for 20% or more of theworld's oil,will cease as insurance rates for those vessels goesthrough the roof. Themonster of war will be unleashed, and willnot easily be defeated.That's why Adm. Fallon was so opposed to thewhole idea. He knows thatit will be a disaster for the US militarily,economically andpolitically. The worst part is that Cheneyknows this, too. Hejust doesn't care. This is the man's parting shotas he leavesoffice--to put the country into the throes of a war sovicious that noone will think of pursuing him for his long list ofcrimes against thenation and the Constitution. He isguessing--and he may beright--that the American public will,sheep-like as always, rally to thecause, with a new round of yellowmagnet "ribbons" on their cars. He ishoping--and he may be right--thatwar will be a boon for the candidacyof Republican John McCain and forembattled Republicans running forCongress. It's a kind of political Hail Mary.
