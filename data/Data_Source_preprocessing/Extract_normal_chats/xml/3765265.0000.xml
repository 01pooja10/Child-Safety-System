 <body>French party leader given 3 month suspended jail sentence and fined for saying Nazi occupation "wasn't that bad"...hmmm, so apparently saying something offensive in France is a crime....guess that's what happens when the PC police get control.</body>

 <body>The vichy regime is still a touchy subject, thats like if germans shouted in the german parlaiment that hitler was a swell guy, it would be bad publicity, draw negative public attention and the french dont need that. they already have their own issues they dont need the world calling them nazis just quite yet. maybe in time it wont be so taboo to talk about the Vichy regime but right now theres still alot of people that remeber it first hand</body>

 <body>I remember when Farley Mowat (canadian writer) was banned from entering the US, dubbed as a communist, because he wrote about how wolves were not the killers that people feared.</body>
