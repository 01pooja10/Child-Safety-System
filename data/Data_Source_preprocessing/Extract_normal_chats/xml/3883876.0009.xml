 <body>  Yeah.  It used to be done for mentally challenged who were not deemed capable of achieving adult level mental competence to be able to care for kids ... and to prevent more of the same from being born.</body>

 <body>  I'm sure there's way more people do this than I'm aware. My sister had 5 kids. Cripes.  They tell you not to get preagant for at least a year after giving birth because it takes that long to replenish the nutrients you lost.  So say the woman turns her life around and has a stable home and husband, she's SOL?</body>

 <body>Instead of stopping her reproductive abilities... stop her reson for reproducing. quit allowing her to receive checks! some new legislation should be passed saying that if the state has 2 or more children in their custody, you get no more checks for any more children that you have. You are on your own!!!! They'll think twice about having kids for profit. IMHO</body>
