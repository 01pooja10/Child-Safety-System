 <body> No. Its personal choice. Your health unless it effects society (as in something highly contagious) is a personal decision. It doesnt matter if you base your chgoice on a fortune cookie. Its your life.</body>

 <body>   No, no, no...that's not how these tele-evangelists get 100 million bones in the bank and still have the nerve to ask for donations for $36 million Gulfstream jets that cost $6000/month to maintain.  It's the stupid message of "Give a bunch of money to my ministry and you will be just as rich in return!"  The church I used to go to, which to me was quite unlistenable as the pastor's only message was about he got shot and he's now prosperous as the congregation helped him put a huge downpyment on a Lexus, was nothing but a pit stop for donations.  This was Jesse Duplantis--in trouble with eyeballers of ministry finances all over--message EVERY TIME I begrudgingly saw him.ÃÂ   "Everyone...stand up!"  "If you are debt-free....sit down!"  "Everyone else that's standing...if you want to be rich and prosper...BUY MY BOOKS!"ÃÂ  (WTF???)  After that, it was a bunch of stupid jokes that I'd heard before.  I never had the money to give and I never got the "you're blessed by what you give" mantra, because that's just wrong quite frankly, but at least my parents stopped this donation crap once I let them in on the ponzi scheme run by many of these big shots.  Benny Hinn's skank daughter gets a senior summer trip from donations...that was their sign to stop.  It's people's greed on both sides, that's all there is to that.</body>

 <body> Are you kidding? IN a religious fanatic/anti-science society like the US?  Fat chance... That's like trying to sue the US government.</body>

 <body>I think if there where a statue that has criminalized stupidity in some way thereÃ¢â¬â¢s an avenue for prosecution aside from that no.  PS DonÃ¢â¬â¢t buy a Benny Hinn CD the hole heals up in a week and all youÃ¢â¬â¢re left with is a shiny $14.99 coaster.</body>
