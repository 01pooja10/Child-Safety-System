      <body>http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=343&amp;sid=1429208  Supreme Court says Americans have right to guns By MARK SHERMAN Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court says Americans have a right to own guns for self-defense and hunting, the justices' first major pronouncement on gun rights in U.S. history.  The court's 5-4 ruling strikes down the District of Columbia's 32-year-old ban on handguns as incompatible with gun rights under the Second Amendment. The decision goes further than even the Bush administration wanted, but probably leaves most firearms laws intact.  The court had not conclusively interpreted the Second Amendment since its ratification in 1791. The amendment reads: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."  The basic issue for the justices was whether the amendment protects an individual's right to own guns no matter what, or whether that right is somehow tied to service in a state militia.

      <body>  at heart, americans kinda like to kill each other so there are two things you'll never see, a ban on guns or a ban ..ion. so get over it and move on to things you can actually do something about, raising the standard of living for all americans, better education, including sex education, better jobs, etc.  those things will have more impact on the death toll than banning guns or abortion.</body>

      <body>A 5-4 decision again? The other 4 should be tested for crack cocaine. A triumph for the 2nd amendment, but mark my words, one day they will come for your guns.</body>
