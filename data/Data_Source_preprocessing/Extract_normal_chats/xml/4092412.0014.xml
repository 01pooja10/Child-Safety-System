 <body>  Did you watch the whole film? It's obvious why he went back with her. He's an idiot rapist! Many rapists actually believe their victims want to be raped. He felt she liked it and was coming back for seconds, or would that be fourths or fifths? She convinced him when she shot at him one minute, then relinquished the gun. Like I said, he's a freakin' idiot. Who the fuck would even do that to another person in the first place?  This was the uncut version I believe, and I got it from Netflix.  Glad I could entertain you Heidi, I'm a regular Roger Ebert! lol  But seriously, where are all the black movie reviewers? Roger is an honorary brother, but I think I'm going to send in an application.</body>

 <body>There is one in NJ that I know of and I think there is still one in PA and CA. Not sure about anywhere else. I love drive ins? Loved this movie, revenge is a bitch. I saw it years ago and this was the first film I saw where a woman just fucked her attackers up. Loved that!!! Glad you watched it again. I told you :)</body>

 <body>You were correct miss lady! As I reflect back on it, I did find it somewhat disturbing that she allowed the mentally challenged dude to have sex with her before killing him. Did she feel sorry for him and did not want him to die a virgin? I get getting naked with the lead dude to castrate him in the tub, but the hanging thing didn't really make sense. I thought she did it to make it look like a suicide at first, but nope.</body>

 <body>Another one bites the dust huh. Too bad. Going to the drive in as a kid was such fun. Glad to hear there is still one in NJ. And the last two murders weren't sexual really. She didn't have to get naked at all! And I am torn, should I have been happy or sad that she didn;t get naked.</body>

 <body>Didn't I read somewhere that they are currently remaking this film?  We had the Star-Lite Drive In for many years here but back in the late 1980s it was shut down and converted to a swap meet, which is still is to this day. The giant movie screen is still up and everything though.</body>

 <body>Also wanted to add that, while I Spit on your Grave probably does have the most disturbingly graphic rape depictions, does anyone else remember Mother's Day? A bizarre 1980s, direct-to-video(I think) slasher that had the family of backwoods retards who kidnap and rape a group of female campers(the men do while their crazy old mom watches and laughs) and, like I Spit..., features a few of the surviving girls getting revenge on the hicks(one notable scene involved someone downing some Draino) towards the end but the whole thing was disturbing as Hell to me back then. I have not seen it since then though so it maybe just a cheese-fest I do not remember well.  Also Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has a scene or two that put me off of horror flicks for a while.</body>
