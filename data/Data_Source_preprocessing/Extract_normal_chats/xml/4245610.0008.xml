 <body> Well at least you tried; it is sad that individuals post about someoneâs experience and forget the candidate they are voting for has less.</body>

 <body>    Really?   Obama: Running local community projects.  12 years of State/National political experience.    Palin: 10 years city experience. 2 years state experience.     I guess if running a small city is now more important than passing state legislation...</body>

 <body>Please use the little intelligence you do have and read up about your candidate. Even her own advisers dissent about her qualifications.  A Palin associate and McCain adviser, according to CNN, defended their strategy of limiting Palinâs interaction with the media because âshe was not ready and that the missteps could have been a lot worse.â  "Her lack of fundamental understanding of some key issues was dramatic," said another McCain source with direct knowledge of the process to prepare Palin after she was picked. The source said it was probably the "hardest" to get her "up to speed than any candidate in history."  Read more about it @ http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/27/palin.tension/index.html</body>

 <body>  A small city that doesn't have jurisdiction over the schools, fire department, social services...  The mayor of Wasilla is responsible for less than an Applebees Manager.</body>

 <body>    Last I checked, the Vice President, as a position, has no direct executive responsibilities. In fact, it is more of a legislative job. Maybe she is running for the wrong position?</body>

 <body> Really? So someone didn't come up with Joe six-pack or Catie Citizen or Tito the Builder or any of those other cute nicknames she uses to describe the US masses? Those stereotypes are all hers? What about the constant lectures about Obama and Biden instead of Answering the questions about her foreign and economic policies? Really? That was all her huh, well, now my confidence in her is even lower.... Thanks!</body>
