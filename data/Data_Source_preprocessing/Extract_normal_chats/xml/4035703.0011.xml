      <body>  I believe the prisons do a good job at handing out death sentences to child rapists already. Though in the case of Jessica Lunsford, that fucking bottom feeder deserves punishment beyond death. And something in my soul tells me he's going to get it.</body>

      <body>   rofl .. general population is always a beautiful way of letting child rapists know exactly where as a society we stand when concerning this horrific issue.  These people aren't sick, they're deadmen walking.</body>

      <body>I don't really see how this is breaking news - our constitution has been saying the same exact thing since 1789.</body>

      <body>I'm listening to this story on the radio now...  Looking for the TEXT of the ruling.  The text was read on the radio and it is POWERFUL  It says that any other decision would be unconstitutional by the fact that it would alter the constitution.</body>

      <body>  Yes, but the  court had not conclusively interpreted the Second Amendment since its ratification in 1791.</body>

      <body>http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf  Sorry... can't seem to pull the text from the PDF.   **********************  The Federalist Papers (the expalinations of the constitution published by the Founding Fathers asking the people to vote to ratify the constitution...  Gave a good explaination of the purpose of the 2nd ammendment.  What it adds up to is:  The people need the ability to oppose an oppressive GOVERNMENT with force.  Yep... the purpose is for the people to be able to REMOVE the people from office by force if they overstep thier constitutional powers.  By the ORIGINAL meaning... we should be allowed to buy fully operational M1 Abrams tanks if we want to.</body>

      <body>Im glad the wisdom of the court finally sees fit to agree with natural law and the God given right to self preservation.  I think the other four ARE child rapists.</body>
