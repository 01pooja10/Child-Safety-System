      <body>Since fuel costs about twice as much in Europe as in the U.S., since oil has a world-wide price and the cost of refining is about the same everywhere, the difference is taxes.  Perhaps the Socialist governments should reduce some fo the taxes in an aeffort to not destroy their own countries.  And if you think prices are high now, just wait until Iran gets their nukes working (something that I notice the leftists think they should do.)</body>

      <body>i think this is a temporary problem, once the government negotiates with the union it will be taken care of, the lesson will be learned.</body>

      <body>I got me a little 125cc bike at the moment. I put £5 in it and it does 100 miles or so.  I use it instead of my car at the moment. The car does 100 miles on about £14.  I think the future is mopeds.</body>

      <body>I would say that 99% of people don't give two shits about the environment. If petrol was cheap, I would have an American muscle car.  As it is, I use my Suzuki marauder to cruise about.  And that is so in America, you love your big old dumb cars.</body>

      <body>Thing is, the entire time the 'socialist' Europeans have been taxing oil, they have been using that money to build one of the greatest public transport networks imaginable. So for your average joe it ain't going to be that hard to get around, but for the haulage industry it has been hard, as their petrol 'allowance' probably hasn't gone up.  This is has really got me excited, with rising fuel prices, world food shortage and the domestic economy, it seems like the shits hitting the fan hard. I am going to enjoy the next five years.</body>
