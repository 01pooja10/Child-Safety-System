      <body>In total...From a studio standpoint it's much easier to go with a sure thing and proven commodities/formulas than to risk allot of money an a "personal original film" from an artist(which can take years to create and make).</body>

      <body>  True but its still early for Avatar but i do reckon by Christmas this year Cameron will definately send us a present to hold us until Dec 2009.  I mean the Viral marketing for The Dark Knight didn't begin until a year before it was due release to hit Cinema, when we saw that beautiful teaser revealing Ledger voice and laugh.</body>

      <body>Because too much thought is put on special effects and not enough on the scripts.</body>

      <body>Yes, a lot of new movies are garbage. A lot of old movies are also garbage. There has always been garbage and there will always be garbage. Still, some really good movies are being made. It's just that most people don't bother to go see them. Because they are FOREIGN. *shocking* That said, a lot of foreign films are also garbage. :lol:</body>

      <body>Because they are trying to sell tickets. Crap sells just as good as quality. Not as many, mind you if the project sucks, but it sells. In this corner we have Iron Man. In the other corner we have Never Back Down. Movies are not about artistic expression or character development and a good plot. It's about making whatever it is PG-13 so kids with money can go see it alone and spend that money on tickets.</body>

      <body> Exactly, and if you don't believe what he just said.. Just try giving New Line a call.. oh wait you can't, because they are now owned by WB, since that Failure called the Golden Compass tanked horribly.. even despite doing very, very well overseas it was still a 75% loss..</body>

      <body>  Actually it wasn't because of 'The Golden Compass.'  It was due to subsidary copyright issues concerning 'The Hobbit movie' they were sued by Tolkien Enterprises. In which the law suit fee was so high that New Line waived them self into Warner Bros, in New Line is a subsidary production unit of Time Warner. They have only done this until they recover enough cash to rebuild themselves</body>
