      <body>  As for the movie... I'm not really interested in seeing it. Stone hasn't made a film that's interested me since U-Turn. Yeah, that was hardly cinematic greatness but it was interesting.</body>

      <body> once again i did INCLUDE myself as well being a American and all......cause i do things like that myself sometimes...  And i can care less if your a Liberal, Conservative, green party, Gay, Jew whatever, it doesn't matter to me because i don't live by labels, but it appears if you live in America you are forced to because that's just the way things are here.. I don't discriminate my discriminations, i attack any, all, and everyone. Sort of like South Park....</body>
