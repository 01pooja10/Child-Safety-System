      <body>   There is a fine line between actors and models.  For some the line is finer than for others.  I for one, watched the movie SIMPLY to see attractive actors on a beautiful beach location.  In the DVD featurettes, the actors stated as a simple fact that they were selected for their looks.  It was completely an unapologetic eye-candy fest.  And it delievered.  Every movie doesn't have to be Saving Private Ryan.  Some movies just need actors that are good-looking and charismatic...</body>
