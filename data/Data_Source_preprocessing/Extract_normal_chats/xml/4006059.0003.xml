      <body>i think this is a temporary problem, once the government negotiates with the union it will be taken care of, the lesson will be learned.</body>

      <body>I got me a little 125cc bike at the moment. I put £5 in it and it does 100 miles or so.  I use it instead of my car at the moment. The car does 100 miles on about £14.  I think the future is mopeds.</body>

      <body>I would say that 99% of people don't give two shits about the environment. If petrol was cheap, I would have an American muscle car.  As it is, I use my Suzuki marauder to cruise about.  And that is so in America, you love your big old dumb cars.</body>

      <body>Thing is, the entire time the 'socialist' Europeans have been taxing oil, they have been using that money to build one of the greatest public transport networks imaginable. So for your average joe it ain't going to be that hard to get around, but for the haulage industry it has been hard, as their petrol 'allowance' probably hasn't gone up.  This is has really got me excited, with rising fuel prices, world food shortage and the domestic economy, it seems like the shits hitting the fan hard. I am going to enjoy the next five years.</body>

      <body>the public bus system is shit where I live. We have two buses a day come through where I live, and they expect me to give up my car.  The buses are normally empty, the only reason that they have about 5 people on them is because they give free bus passes to old people (like my mum).  Public transport in Britain is shite.</body>

      <body>japanese bikes are the best quality &amp; price. i think only ignorant or selfish people dont care about the enviornment, people who dont care about future generations or just dont know or want to know in denial, willingly blind not accepting reality to feel better about their life.</body>
