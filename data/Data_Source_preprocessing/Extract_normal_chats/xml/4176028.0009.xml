 <body> Hmm, give everybody health care and strengthen the lower class? So, I have to pay for all of the lazy ass people out there that don't want to get a job and give more hand outs to the lower class...I say hell no. But, you probably think to tax the rich is a good plan. As for the hunting...when was the last time you ate at McDonald or was that hair dye animal tested?</body>

 <body>  You are fucking ignorant. My mom. A 57 year old woman. lives in 500sf apartment in ghetto and she works 4 jobs. she can not afford health care. oh yeah but she is just lazy as all hell. unfortunately there are hundreds of thousands of lazy people like that in america I guess, by your logic. Those lazy mother fuckers need a couple more jobs and maybe sell their ass on the street huh?  With the price of tax going up it would pay for YOUR health care. YOU are not paying for anyone else. add it up dumb ass. My husbands parents pay 1700 each a month for their health care. Do you know why it is so high? Because that is how much Kaiser decided to charge them that much, no reason. But with free health care you get so much more. free mental health. free doctors visits. free medicine. free surgery. free dentistry. ect!  Do you have any idea how much, in our current world that would cost to get insurance for? wayy more than we would be paying on taxes a month.  Yes taking the insanely rich More than the poor is a good thing. McCain WANTS to tax the POOR more and give tax cuts to the rich. When I say insanely rich I do not mean like 60 k a year. I mean million..billion and trillionairs.  and no sorry. i do not eat fast food. and i use all organic, non-animal tested products. sorry to crush your hopes and dreams.</body>

 <body>Meg.: You are fucking ignorant. My mom. A 57 year old woman. lives in 500sf apartment in ghetto and she works 4 jobs. she can not afford health care.   Meg is either lying or heartless.  Meg.: My husbands parents pay 1700 each a month for their health care. Do you know why it is so high? Because that is how much Kaiser decided to charge them that much, no reason. But with free health care you get so much more. free mental health. free doctors visits. free medicine. free surgery. free dentistry. ect!  Bless her heart. She thinks doctors, dentists, and psychiatrists work for free.   Meg.: Do you have any idea how much, in our current world that would cost to get insurance for? wayy more than we would be paying on taxes a month.   I wonder why she think this...  Meg.:  i do not eat fast food. and i use all organic, non-animal tested products.   I understand now. Bless her heart.</body>

 <body>first off i was sorta making a joke but i see it failed with ur liberal views. i actually love to watch his show takes me away fromt he stupidity of polictics and makes me laugh again.  oh and i four i wasnt pissing in my pants sorry you grew up that way. and not all conservatives are full a rage i find it fun to debate with Respecftul and educated democrates. but what i do get pissed at i will say is how no one has yet to ask obama the real questions. for example, MSNBC, The View and ophrah have all had obama one thier shows or network and have treated him like a god, and someone who has ben in washington for a long time and knows the answer to everything but yet didnt ask him anything. all the shows we have seen except for ophrah have had mccain on them and have "tried" to attack him but have failed.  if you dont believe me just watch barbra walters on the view who kept trying to attack mccain and make him look bad just cuz he didnt know how many house's he owns which really are all owned by his wifes company. but all they could ask obama was about the rumour of him being related to brad pitt. WOW cuz its so important to know about that.  I say 1 time put both in a room with normal people to ask questions and lets see what happens.  thats all i really mad at everything else is fun to watch, hell even snl got a laugh out of me on the palin look a like.</body>

 <body>social heathcare will fail in this country it hasnt worked anywhere else it wont work here.  i belive we need to make healthcare a little cheaper to a certain degree. we shouldnt just give it away like to do food stamps. the more u give stuff away like that the higher prices go up so you still cant get it. its like when he said if u just tax the corps. they just go up on prices what we need to do is not tax anyone more but to stop all the loop holes in the system. you can raise the tax all you want on the rich they will just find a way out of it.  oh and on you stupid comment about 250K being rich yeah like 30 years ago. my Father makes 140k alone that doesnt include all th bonouses he gets through out the year and the investments he has made and yet he is still struggling a little not alot but he odesnt have a maid or personal driver in fact he dives a 1997 dondge intrepid that needs new brakes and belts. yes he does things with my mom time to time but they work thier ass off to save money for trips. we went from being in a trailer trach area to living in a nicer town. its not 90210 but its safer and better then what we had before and its cuz he worked his ass off and still does.  Sure thier are those who do work hard that need help but thier are just as many in the lower class that dont do anything that expect the govermnt to take care of them and its bull. go watch and see people get food stamps and watch the poeple who pull up in escallades with 22's go get some. its bull so whats going to happen is now my dad and mom are going to have to pay more taxes of rthem to get more free stuff from the gov.</body>

 <body>My uncles make about 250k a year, and the only expensive car they own, is a VW Golf. No butlers, hookers, personal servants, maids, yaddayaddayadda. 28,ooo and barely surviving? Pfft. That's a fine income, now add your husbands into that. Now, if that is both of your incomes combined, you are still well off, just don't have any kids anytime soon. Maybe 28,000 isn't that much in your area? No animal testing products are everywhere, even at your local wally world.</body>
