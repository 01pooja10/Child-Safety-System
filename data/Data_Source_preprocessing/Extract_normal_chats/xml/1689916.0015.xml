 <body>        I was a huge fan of early john cusack movies, the sure thing, one crazy summer, sixteen candles, better off dead. Him and armstrong *booger* did such a great job in the movie. I mean it had a damn good message, lots of humor and a great soundtrack and not to mention    I want my two dollars!</body>

 <body>I've had a hard time getting his movies the last ten years but that'll never take away from the work I was so into with him. Oh god the paper job ....yeah six months my freshman year I think only it was walking and no bike and it sucked, ha. I just got a kick out of the movie. I mean trying to kill himself repeatedly and always failing and the foreign gal, omg I had such a thing for he, never saw her in any other movies sadly enough but she was a damn good co-star in that movie. Ricky also reminds me of some guy we used to slam around in school, not funny to think about now but it was then.</body>
