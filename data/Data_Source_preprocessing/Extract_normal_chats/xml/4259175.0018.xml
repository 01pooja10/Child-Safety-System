 <body>   I seriously doubt Barack X will do anything "GREAT".  His election will only be "HISTORIC" cause hes black.  and this thread proves it.</body>

 <body>   This was a conversation we had about a month ago, and I haven't talked to her since the results were official, but I would image her opinion is still the same.  We were in a mall and this guy stopped us (i was her and a white guy that had an obama shirt on) and he asked us what basically the same question you did, and that's how you answered.  I didn't want to debate her in the mall so I didn't say anything, but I think there obviously is a cultural significance, but I don't know if its a Jackie Robinson type of accomplishment. His accomplishment was ending the ban on black players. Obama isn't breaking down a legal barrier, but it is a social barrier.  IDK, I'm more looking forward to the change he'll bring than his color though.</body>

 <body>  Why did you stop with Barack X? You forgot the Barack Hussein Obama. I cannot get over thehuge irony that here we are in a war with Islamo-fascists and we elect a president named Barack Hussein Obama. hahahahaha. I love it...</body>

 <body>   but race did play a huge part in this election for a lot of people (whether it be for positive or negative reasons). i understand his friend's mentality.  it will definitely be historical and it is certainly something to be proud of, but it was not the first step and it should not be the last.  the real accomplishment will be the day that an african-american, female, asian, gay, atheist, muslim, (ect) president is not considered a change.  this wouldn't mean we are color-blind, it would mean we are finally accepting.</body>

 <body>   Racists often do.  Im not confused. Hes no MLK wannabe, hes a Malcolm X wannabe.  Thats why jesse wanted to cut his nuts off.  Thats why his spiritual mentor, quotes Malcolm X, and hangs out with Louis Farrakahn.  Hes no christian.</body>

 <body>    I agree that race should not play a role. I voted for McCain not because of race, so don't act like people who didn't vote for Barack are not mature enough. I have heard two of my best friends (african americans) tell me they were voting for Barack because he is black. Is that not racist? Could I say I voted for McCain because he is white?? We got in many arguements about this but still remain friends because we dont spew hate at each other but intellectual differences. We definately not living in color blind society. Hell I just got done listening to Al Sharpton continue to live in a race based society. He is not savior on black issues, but a problem. My friends even said that Al Sharpton does not speak for them and shouldn't speak for every african american.</body>

 <body>  Well, you are entitled to your opinion. But need I remind you, your argument assumes that all Christians are saints and all Muslims are demons, and that in of itself is not true..</body>

 <body>  I agree, voting for Obama because he is black and ONLY for that reason is dumb. My reasoning was more along the lines of how Colin Powell came to his conclusion. I honestly do like John McCain and I really hate that his campaign took the turn that he did and he ceased being the 2000 maverick that he once was. His speech last night reminded me of the John McCain that many people love..</body>

 <body>   You said that not me. I never said anything of the kind.  I know plenty of Muslims, and they think Farakahn and Wright are a coupla nut bags. They voted for McCain by the way.  One family owns 2 liquor stores and a gas station and theyve only lived in this country for 10 years. This was thier first US election as voting citizens.  They really thought Americans were gonna kill them after 9/11, and they live in Massachusetts. They pulled thier children outta school cause the other school kids were pretty mean.</body>
