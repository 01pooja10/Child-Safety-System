 <body>well i've heard of the aztecs predicting the end of the world in 2012  also the mayans  and scientists say that the world switches its magnetic polarity every 10,000 years, and its due to happen around that time, which could cause massive movements on the ocean floor (tsunamis incurring), the magma below the crust would get frigged up (volcanoes erupting) ... last time it happened, supposedly the ice age ended  the Bible says the last ruler before the rapture will rule for seven years. Benedict XVI was declared Pope in 2005.... 2005 + 7 = 2012.... and he's old as it is (by the way, I'm baptist, not catholic)  but then again, Revelation says no one will know when it's happening</body>

 <body>I think the bullet people seem to miss is...  yes, the world will end around 2010  but only the horrid, political, bastardized world.  out of who's ashes will rise a new world or tolerance  and general betterment of all living beings  that's how I see it happening   c</body>

 <body>The funny things about possibilities is that they are endless. The world may very well end today, or tomorrow. Or maybe we will have world peace and live on for hundreds of more years. It's hard to say, so calm down and just live your life and what happens, happens.</body>

 <body>The world was also supposed to end in I think 1867. And 1992. And at other very specific dates. It never happened. I'm sure the world will end some day, but when you say it will occur at such and such date by such and such means, you sound like you need to be put away, for a very long time.</body>
