 <body>I watched Revolver last night... And it is really good. The critics that ripped on it and called it a mess are wrong. Sure, it's complicated and might confuse some, but so what. Personally, I loved it.</body>

 <body>  if there was one thing i didn't like it was the very end when they were rolling the credits. i don't know if they have that commentary by doctors and specialists at the end in the dvd release but they did have it in the theatrical release and it annoyed me for some reason. i think it's because it just started to feel a little blow hardy and didn't allow me to think for myself you know? it felt like it was kinda laying things down for me.</body>

 <body>  Yeah, it's there... Didn't bother me. Insert :shrug: smiley here, if we had one.  The only thing that bothered me about it was that I figured out the ending before it happened. Other than that, excellent.  Michelle seems to have liked it. :)</body>

 <body> Yes, I liked it. I also figured out ending. I almost watched Snatch first, but the two of you turned me on enough that I couldn't wait any longer. lol.</body>

 <body>snatch is still a good movie. but yeah revolver really displayed what statham can do. and if you're going to compare the two movies i have to say it'll be hard going to watch snatch now.</body>
