 <body>   and that's EXACTLY what ruined all the past Transformer franchieses. Too much focus on humans, especially annoying little kids.  In Generation 1 the balance was perfect. A lot of fans my age say that the saturation of too many new Transformers ruined Generation 1 and made it get cancelled. I don't think so. I think it was the saturation of Daniel being used too much, too many times when the parents were the focus of attention, then they did what Star Trek and Return Of The Jedi made mistakes with, they brought in too many different alien species, which has the same effect as too many humans. The attention was taken away from the Transformers.</body>

 <body>   Well Mr. Allen, I can't really disagree with you. I'm a TF Fanboy myself. I think I feel a bit of excitement, but that could be anxiety and worry over how bad it might be ruined even more. Instead of a magical cube that they all sprouted up from, they might create some other magical ooze that the cube sprang from without any answers to any questions.</body>

 <body>What really ruined The Transformers movie is the fact that Michael Bay is not a fan of the transformers, and he stated he did'nt want to make a cartoon of the Transformers, The Transformations were to complex, the transformations of the Transformers from past shows were never complex, they were promoting stuff that took away space for putting more information in the script ( Like Mountain Dew, X-Box, ect. ), They had one of the Original voice actors ( Optimus Prime ( AKA Petter Cullen ), and not the other ( Frank Welker ( AKA Megatron ), Way tomany quotes slaming the original series, Not having Bumblebee a VW bug, and yet having a VW bug in the movie!, none of the desgins looked anything near the original desgins of the Transformers, Not having the Matrix Of Leadership, and instead we get some stupid cube ( Hey was'nt the cube in one of the later Transformers shows ), Bay and Hasbro TRANSFORMED this movie in to a pile of crap! ( Anyone feel free to add the transfomation sound effect! ), the whole witwikey background story, and the selling of his gradfathers glasses could have been deleted, and something better put in, I only payed $2.00 to see Transformers, and to be frank it's not even worth $2.00, that would be an insult to the movies that deserve the admition price of $2.00 LOL!</body>
