 <body>Slither and Feast. Fun, campy horror movies, underrated or unseen but worth the time and effort in acquiring. Forget all these pseudo horror movies coming out recently.    And if you like Zombie movies. George Romero is the go to guy. All his movies are social commentaries as well as zombie eating good times.</body>

 <body>I'd go for the Japanese Horror movies such as Ju-On, Ringu and such    and Braindead/Dead Alive was just one big 'gorey' bloodbath. almost comedy.</body>

 <body>    Im Sorry The Hill have eyes Scared the Freaking shit out of me! i wont watch it again! lol.    i watched 60 most scary movies on bravo and they said Hostel was number 1! I get scared too easily, So me tell u a scary movie u probly wouldnt even flintch.    But I do Have to agree with u, The scariest movies are the ones from back in the Day, It, Shinning.. Shit like that i definetly can not watch.. Saw 1 and 2 I thought was made really good. I havent seen 3 yet.. What scare me most about those movies are those are actually real devices that were used to kill people..(spanish tortuing devices) .. Scary!!!!!</body>
