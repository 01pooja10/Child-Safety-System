 <body>  while at one time im sure i would have wholeheartedly agreed, the entire point, the gift if you would of being human, an opposible thumb aside, is the capacity to through intellect and foresight free ourselves from the brutal bondage and base nature of the darwinist design weve clung to for so long as unwaivering truth, as though we as a species who have already overcome so much and already disproven so many preconcieved truths were for some reason incapable of doing so...  it is our duty to help the "stupid"lol....for we were once "stupid" too</body>

 <body>well it is a whole cult issue, but it is the person's choice to not want medical treatment, unless they were brainwashed by set cult or person, but it really depends on the situation before one can really judge if it's right or wrong</body>
