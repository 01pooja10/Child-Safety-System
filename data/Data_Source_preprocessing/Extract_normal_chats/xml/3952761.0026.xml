 <body>What does the Roman Empire have to do with the United States?  So what if they were a republic and they failed? That doesn't mean the US ever will. That's just a stupid argument. That's like saying . . . "oh, Tommy went to college and failed all of his classes, and since Tommy failed, you are doomed to failure too"! Dumb dumb dumb.</body>

 <body> America won't be on top forever Nichols. It might not crash and burn, but it will fade into the background in time. Nothing lasts forever.  As far as Rome goes, its the first thing to jump out at alot of people when they hear the words "empire" or "republic." We could try comparisons to the Ottomans, but it wouldn't reach as broad an audience.</body>

 <body>  The reason they compared it to the US is because the Romans had about the same system of government a Republic. Less government, less taxes, the people were free. Later on the Roman politicians started asking for more people and more government bigger government, more taxes, spreading their empire. This caused a collapse of their economy and the Empire broke down. This is what happened to the United States and it might come crashing down just like the Roman Empire.</body>

 <body> No, I know why they compared it, but my point was that just because one thing fails, doesn't mean the other will.</body>

 <body>LoL... we have over 50 TRILLION in additional debt coming as well. Social security is fucked. There's nothing there. Right now, our social security payments are goign right to the retired. That's fucked up. If it's there at all, that's not how the system was designed to work, and now we are digging ourselves into deeper and deeper debt.  You think 9.4 trillion is bad??? HAHAHAHAH... we've seen NOTHING YET.  Thank the lefties for the "Unified Budget Act" for that one... leftist policies FTL.</body>
