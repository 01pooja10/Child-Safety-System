 <body>I'd go for the Japanese Horror movies such as Ju-On, Ringu and such    and Braindead/Dead Alive was just one big 'gorey' bloodbath. almost comedy.</body>

 <body>    Im Sorry The Hill have eyes Scared the Freaking shit out of me! i wont watch it again! lol.    i watched 60 most scary movies on bravo and they said Hostel was number 1! I get scared too easily, So me tell u a scary movie u probly wouldnt even flintch.    But I do Have to agree with u, The scariest movies are the ones from back in the Day, It, Shinning.. Shit like that i definetly can not watch.. Saw 1 and 2 I thought was made really good. I havent seen 3 yet.. What scare me most about those movies are those are actually real devices that were used to kill people..(spanish tortuing devices) .. Scary!!!!!</body>

 <body>The Descent is scary.    I never saw the Japanese version of The Grudge, but the American version just seemed to be a boo movie. I wondered if the Japanese movie had a stronger story thread.    Creepy kids and herky-jerky dead people used to get me going, but the herky-jerky stuff has become a cottage industry. People who use it now should pay a royalty.</body>

 <body>Have you seen the movie May? Wasnt really scary but it was pretty disturbing..    I have yet to see any really scary movies latly. i think I may be immune to horror now.    cabin fever n hostle were the shit. i love movies like that that havent been done and are based in some sort of reality. it could happen.</body>
