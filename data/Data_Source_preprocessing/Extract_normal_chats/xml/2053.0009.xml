      <body>I've found that the people who complain about it being like high school are the same people that went to high school within 25-30 miles of it. That's the problem with a lot of commuter schools, (I grew up near Sacramento State).    I've also found that the people who love it tend to be the one's who get themselves involved. I moved onto campus at CSULB 2 1/2 years ago not knowing a single person -- and now I know plenty of people. I have more friends now than I did in high school and a more active social life for sure. And I was damn busy with my life in high school!        College is what you make it.      Although I will say that the lack of football or other tailgating sport may contribute to the lack of school spirit. But, really, often when I'm out and about wearing CSULB stuff (either in northern or southern california) people will come up and start talking to me about our sports anyway... I just smile and tell them that the sociology and human development are good.</body>

      <body>For those who complain about not being able to meet people or it's like high school, then they should really put themselves out there to meet new people. I've been at Long Beach State for 4 years now and I have tons of school spirit, more friends than I could count, met hundreds of hot girls, partied like there was no tomorrow, and taken some of the most thought provoking classes that makes you really think about life.  College is about being on your own and having freedom, it's not about sticking to your old high school buddies because it's comfortable or cuz you're too much of a pussy to get out there and make something happen for yourself. Like the saying goes, "GO BEACH OR GO HOME!!!"</body>

      <body>Damn little freshman. The Beach is where it's at. You're probably not having a good time and think it's too much like high school cuz you're only stickin too your little high school friends. You're in college now, get out there and meet people! In other words...grow up!</body>
