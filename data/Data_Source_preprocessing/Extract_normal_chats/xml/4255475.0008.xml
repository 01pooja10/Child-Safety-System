 <body> If he hadn't died, his performance as the Joker would have been the start of something really big for him. The Dark Knight seems to have spurred many, many people who never saw a Heath Ledger movie before to go back and review his earlier work.</body>

 <body>I don't know what the big deal was about the Dark Knight, batman's voice was stupid and over done and heath ledger did a horrible job. Im glad he died. Nothing beats Jack Nickolson's performance of the Joker</body>
