      <body>OK, nevermind I stopped being net lazy and looked.  Yes, it's him  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175262/  And I spelled his name wrong.  It's Billy Connolly.   Here's part of his comedic stand up act.   He was also the weird reptile dude in The Adventures of Lemony Snicket with Jim Carrey.       </body>

      <body>From what I can tell, yes. It doesn't look bad, but from the trailer it looks like they were lieing when they said that it wasn't going to be a movie that involved the big "governmant conspiracy" that the show more or less was built around in the last half of the series. It may still be a plain monster movie, which I read it was going to be, but a couple of those shots in the trailer reminded me of the first movie a lot.</body>

      <body>  How can you yawn about something that's been out of the lime light for 10 years give or take and not around except for on TV at 1 AM?</body>

      <body>   They've made 5 Batman movies, and one was a complete stinker. But you're still liking them and giving them a chance right?</body>

      <body>  No I'm pretty much fed up of comic book movies now. The X-Files lost me as soon as the whole government conspiracy stuff started happening. Up until then it was brilliant. Also it worked brilliantly as a tv series, with the interaction between Mulder and Scully. However it doesn't work as an action packed thriller.</body>

      <body> I agree, I watched the show way back but a new movie just doesn't interest me.</body>

      <body>I liked it all the way until the end. I just hated how the series ended. It was about as enlightening as The Matrix 3 as far as answering questions. I even liked Robert Patrick in there. I felt like he gave us a break from the mystical deep sci fi stuff. Too much of the Sci Fi Conspiracy got to thick. When they put Robert Patrick in there as the real down to earth dude thinking, "HAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE, YOU PEOPLE ARE NUTS" I thought that was kind of cool. Plus I just like Robert Patrick.</body>
