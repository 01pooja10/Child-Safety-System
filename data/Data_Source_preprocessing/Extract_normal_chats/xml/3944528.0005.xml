      <body>   Hey Bob, what the hell is the Bush/Cheney avatar all about. You DO know that Bush and Cheney are the biggest mass murderers of the 21st century right? Hmmm...I think you should be banned just for having that avatar...but that's just me, and pretty much the rest of the world.</body>

      <body>  A good question to Obama supporters and especially the black voters. Would you support Hillary Clinton if she was chosen to be the nominee by the superdelegates?</body>

      <body>It's pretty obvious they are going to try and play up her possible win West Virginia as the "unexpected game changer", now she just has to hope she has the momentum to do so.</body>

      <body>  You haven't been around politics long, son.Â  I'm a Ron Paul supporter and I say that's within the realm of possibility--all's fair in love, war, and politics, and that kind of thing's been done before.Â  Read history and learn something.</body>

      <body>  Well that is a good example of a black voter taking control of the situation rather than being controlled by the situation. I just ask this question just in case it might turn out that way. I just hope black voters will still turn out for Hillary even though it has been a rough primary. Hillary really did not have a choice but to be on the offensive against Obama and throw the kitchen sink at him due to the fact that Obama did take her by surprise with overwhelming victories after Super Tuesday. But it is definitely in Obama's favor right now to be the nominee. Good luck to all candidate.</body>

      <body> She herself was heard to say that she could claim big momentum just by a sweep in Puerto Rico.  She's changed her metrics from popular vote to superdelegate count to Big Mo. She's desperate.</body>
