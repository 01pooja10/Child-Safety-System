 <body>    Plus the actor playing Bond is usually British. So Denzel fails anyway, even if they were to have a black bond it would be a British black actor.</body>

 <body>    I say no to the black actor idea also. Not for any reasons people knee jerk about, but because we have a history with James Bond. Don't go messin that up. As the other person said already, create a whole new character and series. Sort of like they did with XxX.</body>

 <body>James Bond has always been white. Not to sound racial but it should stay that way or it'd change everything that is James Bond. Can you imagine someone like Jet Li being James Bond? It just would be James Bond anymore.</body>

 <body>    Yeah it would be Enter The Dragon or something. Keep historical figures the way they have always been, and make up new characters.    People got mad when they changed Cat Woman. But there was a black cat woman in the 60s, I forgot her name.    I got upset when they changed The Green Lanern to a black guy. I figured they caved under political correctness. But somebody told me that there are 100s of Green Lanterns from another planet.    But when there is a historical track record of a character, keep him the way he has always been (or her).</body>
