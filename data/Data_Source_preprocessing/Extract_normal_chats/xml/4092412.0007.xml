 <body>That movie had a million plot holes. Like they guy who gets killed in the bath tub. Why did he not freak out when he saw that girl again? Did he really think she wanted to hook up after what he done to her?</body>

 <body>  Did you watch the whole film? It's obvious why he went back with her. He's an idiot rapist! Many rapists actually believe their victims want to be raped. He felt she liked it and was coming back for seconds, or would that be fourths or fifths? She convinced him when she shot at him one minute, then relinquished the gun. Like I said, he's a freakin' idiot. Who the fuck would even do that to another person in the first place?  This was the uncut version I believe, and I got it from Netflix.  Glad I could entertain you Heidi, I'm a regular Roger Ebert! lol  But seriously, where are all the black movie reviewers? Roger is an honorary brother, but I think I'm going to send in an application.</body>

 <body>There is one in NJ that I know of and I think there is still one in PA and CA. Not sure about anywhere else. I love drive ins? Loved this movie, revenge is a bitch. I saw it years ago and this was the first film I saw where a woman just fucked her attackers up. Loved that!!! Glad you watched it again. I told you :)</body>
