 <body>  Actually he has 3 friends in the movie forum! lol  Don't argue with C.Allen, he's just a forum troll that likes to play keyboard ninja and go around the forum cussing people out for attention. Just ignore him and maybe he'll go back to masturbating to his "cammed" copy of The dark Knight!</body>

 <body>I see you have a new profile picture. You must've saved up big time for that vacation. Must be good to not have to use the same old pool this year. ..</body>

 <body>Batman saves Harvey.....the girlfriend dies.  Two-face falls to his death in the end.  Joker gets arrested.  The boat with the prisoners on it....they throw the detonator out the window...the other boat doesn't have the courage to push it.  He never shows his true identity....he lets Harvey be a decoy.  The girl chooses Harvey in the note.  The Joker kills the asian guy by burning him on top of a stack of money.  Oh...and in the prison...the guy with the stomach ache has a bomb inside of him...</body>
