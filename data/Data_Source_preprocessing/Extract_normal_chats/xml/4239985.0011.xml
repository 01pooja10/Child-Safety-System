      <body>  I'm sure it's incredibly early to tell, but is this the beginning of the splits of the Republican Party?</body>

      <body>  Not only is his last name "Tinklenberg" his first name is "Elwyn". Not that I give a crap, but it isn't one of those strong Anglo-Saxon names that looks good on a ballot.  He seems to be a pretty decent guy nonetheless, from the debate transcripts I read.  A solid moderate democrat, and not a partisan hack.  TINKLENBERG 08!!</body>

      <body>  I'm not sure if it is a split, but I think the GOP will have to wander in the wilderness for a few years to find itself again at the very least.</body>

      <body>  Most probably that. The GOP needs to, no doubt. Hopefully they will, and drop the social and neoconservative wings of the party.</body>

      <body>  He was up three points earlier but right now is just up two.  Should be interesting.  And she made me get into a fight with a Republican colleague of mine.</body>
