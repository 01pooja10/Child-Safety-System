 <body>  reagan was a demagogue.ÃÂ  I see that now.ÃÂ  But he did effectively enrapture the nation in patriotism, to a fault.ÃÂ  most didn't see the fractured thinking of reaganomics until the 90's when it was too late.ÃÂ  the reason that you're not hearing from reagan conservatives is because most have morph'd either into the army of "compassionate conservatives" or as myself have morph'd into independent voters who look a little more analytically at politics now.</body>

 <body>  So you're a racist too then? Got ya.  I wouldn't have said that, no matter how close a friend he was to me. The fact is he's a racist, so is Lott, and Lott even went on a crying jag apologizing left and right for his remarks.  Even he thinks it was wrong.</body>
