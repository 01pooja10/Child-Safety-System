 <body>Its the end of the world as we know it.There will be parents running for their children, extreme tornadoes, volcanoes erupting unasully fast, and frecuntly. There will be airplanes droping bombs becuase there will be a world war 3. There will be people aiming guns at each other threatening to kill, some people will atempt suicide, others will despretly build a basement which will not work due to floods, lava, and maybe even people coming and killing them.And i know, noone wants to die including me, but its got to come one day, we cant live for 200 years, we cant live again, this is our only lifes we have.The only lives we know , and the only lifes we will live.We can never go back to being a kid, we can, but it is the same life over and over again in our heads.We cant change the past, or the future.Its got to happen.We cant say, "No it cant end because its too early, its got to happen more in the future."Problem with that is that this is the future.People dont understand.Its gonna happen in our lifes.I dont know how its gonna feel, but i know that after it, the pain will be gone, and we are gonna be in the place we read about every day. Either hell, or hevan.Its gonna happen right here, right now.This is the end of the world as we know it, this is 2012...</body>

 <body>well i've heard of the aztecs predicting the end of the world in 2012  also the mayans  and scientists say that the world switches its magnetic polarity every 10,000 years, and its due to happen around that time, which could cause massive movements on the ocean floor (tsunamis incurring), the magma below the crust would get frigged up (volcanoes erupting) ... last time it happened, supposedly the ice age ended  the Bible says the last ruler before the rapture will rule for seven years. Benedict XVI was declared Pope in 2005.... 2005 + 7 = 2012.... and he's old as it is (by the way, I'm baptist, not catholic)  but then again, Revelation says no one will know when it's happening</body>

 <body>I think the bullet people seem to miss is...  yes, the world will end around 2010  but only the horrid, political, bastardized world.  out of who's ashes will rise a new world or tolerance  and general betterment of all living beings  that's how I see it happening   c</body>

 <body>The funny things about possibilities is that they are endless. The world may very well end today, or tomorrow. Or maybe we will have world peace and live on for hundreds of more years. It's hard to say, so calm down and just live your life and what happens, happens.</body>

 <body>The world was also supposed to end in I think 1867. And 1992. And at other very specific dates. It never happened. I'm sure the world will end some day, but when you say it will occur at such and such date by such and such means, you sound like you need to be put away, for a very long time.</body>
