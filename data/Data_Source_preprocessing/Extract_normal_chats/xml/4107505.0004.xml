      <body>That piece of filth got what he deserved! All these far-lefft loons have gone crazy, they care more about the killer than about the victim. They will never remember the two girls he raped and killed.</body>

      <body>I don't know what disgusts me more...  The fact that the bastard raped those two girls, the fact that he hypocritcally preached against hatred (he deserved it for what he did to those poor girls), or the fact that the Mexican government is basically endorsing his crimes.  Hear me illegal aliens, look, if you're so determined why don't you overthrow the assholes in charge of Mexico and make it a better place to live? Or do you condone these heinous actions yourself?  Seriously anyone who defends these bastards should themselves be put in jail. He is just lucky I wasn't there. He meaning both the rapist and the government official.</body>

      <body>"nobody has the right to take another..."  He took TWO lives! TWO! And here he is saying that his cousin is worth more than the two girls he strangled and violated?  Sorry the statement of the cousin just pissed me off enough to warrant its own rant.</body>

      <body>"Texas executed Medellin, 33, late Tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in Houston."  "The Mexican government statement said officials 'were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.' "  A couple of points: 1) why did it take 15 years to off this pond scum?Â  2) If Mexico is soooooooooooooo concerned about the treatment of their citizens in the USA, why don't they stop encouraging them to come here?</body>

      <body>  I'd also like to point out that government execution is not a matter of one man deciding to take the life of another man. It is by the LAW that this waste of space was executed.Â  The LAW DOES have the right.</body>

      <body>Everyone seems to be missing the point here. By deliberately renouncing the Vienna Convention, U.S. citizens abroad no longer have a right to request consular assistance. The world is fully cognoscente that the word of the United States on an international treaty is now worthless.</body>

      <body>  I call Bullshit. Americans are held responsible to the laws of other countries, always have been, always will be. Don't think so? Go spit on the sidewalk in Singapore, see what happens.</body>

      <body>Call it bullshit if you want. If said American citizen was arrested for spitting on a Singapore sidewalk before today, the government of Singapore would be required to advise the American consulate in Singapore of the arrest and grant consular access to the arrested party. Yes, the poor slob would probably not avoid a fine and/or jail time but the consulate would be able to ensure that his rights were honoured under Singapore law and assist him in retaining local counsel. As of today, Singapore no longer has to advise the consulate nor permit consular access.</body>

      <body>  I belive your statement is based on the FALSE assertion that this scum bag was denied the right to speak to a Mexican Consular. He was in fact NOT denied that right.Â  He and his legal council both neglected to request to speak to the Mexican Consular.Â  If they had requested, they would have been granted their request.Â  It wasn't until AFTER his conviction and AFTER his appeals that they finally decided to mention that he wasn't a US citizen, which is what everyone was previously lead to believe.Â   Neither theÂ prosecution, nor the court had any knowledge of the nation of origin of this douche.Â  Due to the circumstances of his conviction, the world court has NO JURISDICTION over this case.Â  They would like to have, and they might try to say that they have it ... but they don't.Â  Even the US Supreme court reviewed it &amp; agreed that the world court has no jurisdiction.</body>
