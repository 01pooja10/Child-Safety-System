 <body>I really don't get these psycho fanboys attacking everyone who didn't like the damn movie. It's a f***ing Batman movie, grow up!  All your bitching and moaning won't change the fact that the movie was just "OK" and nonething more.  No one deserves an oscar and no new ground was broke.  The f***ing Batmobile was stopped by a stupid rocket launcher! WTF?? ha ha ha!  It was a kids movie written to appeal to the emo generation... I guess that explains all the "boo hoos" and "I'll kill myself if Heath don't get an oscar!"  Some of you REALLY need to get outside more ;)</body>

 <body> haha...says the guy who hunts down every single TDK thread to post the SAME thing...you need to go out more...and maybe see more movies to talk about...because your rhetoric on this one has grown tiresome... Isn't there a new mask out there somewhere to discover?</body>

 <body> i dont' want anyone saying this movie is cheesy until they see the original with Adam West... I shudder at the thought -_-  Besides.. Super Heroes are cheesy. They are grown men who wear skin tight costumes and underwear on the outside that can fly and have super strength. It doesn't matter how awesome you make a super hero movie, the premise is still cheesy.  But I loves the super heroes :)</body>

 <body>  Yep. Mawkishness is running riot in the US at the moment. Ledger will win an Oscar because of is untimely death rather than his role and that is actually rather insulting to his memory, in my opinion.  A.</body>
