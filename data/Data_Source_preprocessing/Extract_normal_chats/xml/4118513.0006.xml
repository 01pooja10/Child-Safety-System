 <body>What do you mean Sin City wasn't all his? I remember seeing an interview withMiller saying that he didn't direct a shot, but was there for advice for a lot of the filming, so Rodriguez insisted that he take a co-director credit. I'm sure he helped make it great, but that movie in and of itself was all Rodriguez. That said, I'd agree to all the movies listed so far as being worth watching. In your post and the other with a list. I'd throw in Once Upon a Time in Mexico, but mainly only for Depp's performance.</body>
