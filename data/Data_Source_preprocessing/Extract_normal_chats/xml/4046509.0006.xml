      <body>  How can you yawn about something that's been out of the lime light for 10 years give or take and not around except for on TV at 1 AM?</body>

      <body>   They've made 5 Batman movies, and one was a complete stinker. But you're still liking them and giving them a chance right?</body>

      <body>  No I'm pretty much fed up of comic book movies now. The X-Files lost me as soon as the whole government conspiracy stuff started happening. Up until then it was brilliant. Also it worked brilliantly as a tv series, with the interaction between Mulder and Scully. However it doesn't work as an action packed thriller.</body>

      <body> I agree, I watched the show way back but a new movie just doesn't interest me.</body>

      <body>I liked it all the way until the end. I just hated how the series ended. It was about as enlightening as The Matrix 3 as far as answering questions. I even liked Robert Patrick in there. I felt like he gave us a break from the mystical deep sci fi stuff. Too much of the Sci Fi Conspiracy got to thick. When they put Robert Patrick in there as the real down to earth dude thinking, "HAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE, YOU PEOPLE ARE NUTS" I thought that was kind of cool. Plus I just like Robert Patrick.</body>

      <body>I have to agree with you guys about not really caring.The TV series was good for awhile but it got boring and the first movie was a stinker.They'll have to do something spectacular or I'll wait til it comes on cable for free.</body>

      <body>I meant to say the mythology, but that was my point. It looks as if Connaelly is bleeding that black tar crap from his eyes at one point, and there is a shot at the end that looked as if someone was in a cocoon of gunk or whatever they called it when Scully was put in one at the end of the first movie. I hope this all has something to do with some monster or other wordly event that has nothing to do with the "alien conspiracy", because those were the best episodes, IMO. But the images that I mentioned seemed to close to the first movie for comfort.</body>

      <body>I don't know. I liked it all. Alien and Monster. I thought the black stuff was dealing with the Alien conspiracy. I didn't feel they answered that enough and left the viewers still asking questions at the end. It would be cool if they made another movie not for theaters, but for TV. One that would answer all the questions.  This same thing is going to happen with LOST, I know it. People are going to still have questions after the show. Then later they'll revamp it into a movie. And people will react to it in the same way they're reacting to X-Files :)  MARK MY WORDS!!!!  *SHAKING FIST IN THE AIR*</body>

      <body>A lot of the alien stories were great. It's just when they started showing the smoking man in these meetings a bunch old millionaires that supposedlt controlled the government that it started to annoy me. It got to the point that whenevr that guy showed up, I tuned out. But they made some damn creepy monster episodes that are still great. That is what I am hoping for with this movie.</body>
