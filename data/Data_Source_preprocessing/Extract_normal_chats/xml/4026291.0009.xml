 <body> disease like cancer or ms only go into remission doctors never say ur cured just that ur currently cancer free or whatever. They never say there a 100 percent chance of anything.But faith healers do aslong as u have engough faith. Doctors never said i would be able to walk without crutches doctors can only do so much. But the bible says anythiing is possiabel with god, there the big differenc.</body>

 <body>Absolutely not. Health care is a personal choice. People die in hospitals all the time. If your beliefs are not main stream its your choice. Nobody has the right to force an adult into any treatment. Minors are a different story but even then they should have control of choice before 18. We had a kid with some type of cancer here who refused traditional care and his parentsd supported him. I think he was around 16 at the time the court battles started. After a few court battles he won his case and is still alive. It could have killed him but he had the right, its his body. Dont even try to tell I have to follow traditional medical procedures. My body, my choice.</body>

 <body>  It's the 'healers' fault if the healer guarantees results, which they often do. In the doctor case, then, yes, they are sued for malpractice. And no doctor will guarentee results. And, while the scientific community often makes mistakes, they do have that whole scientific method thingy. If a doctor lies to you, yes, he's held accountable. A faith healer will lie to you when they say "my system brings results".</body>

 <body>  I agree here, absolutely. As long as the faith healer, aromatic therapist, etc gives you all the information so you can make the best choice.</body>
