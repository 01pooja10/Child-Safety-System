 <body>   So what you are really saying is that poor people favor democrats. But if that was the case, why aren't the majority of poor white amaericans also democrat? Statistically more white people rely on social services than blacks.</body>

 <body>   Please explian why Reagan would choose to deliver his first campaign speech in Mississippi, at the urging of Trent Lott no less, a known bigot and racist.  This is exactly the kind of denial that the article talks about.</body>

 <body>  If I remember correctly, the freedmen became sharecroppers and then moved to the cities when industry took off. And then industry left, leaving blacks in ghettos with no job skills in service.  If I am wrong, correct me. I slept 4 hours last night.</body>

 <body> Nah you said republicans as a blanket statement.  Black politicians take more advantage of their own race than anyone else. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton.</body>

 <body>  I didn't say all republicans are racist, what I said rather, was that the republican party has a history of racism. Also, the republican party is in denial about this and this is exactly why most blacks will not vote for a republican.  If you read the article, the author suggests that it is a good thing that Bush is reaching out to black voters finally, but it will not work until the republican party adresses it's racism in the past.  I've yet to hear a good reason for Reagan to deliver his initial campaign speech, repleat with overtones of states rights vs federal rights, in Philadelphia, MI, the exact town in which three civil rights workers were murdered in one of the 1960s' ugliest cases of racist violence. It was a ringing declaration of his support for "states' rights" â a code word for resistance to black advances clearly understood by white Southern voters.  If this wasn't race baiting, what was it? Please explain.</body>
