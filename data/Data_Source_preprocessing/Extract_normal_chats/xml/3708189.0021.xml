 <body>    dude id vote for boris if it definatally meant getting rid of ken,  my one beef with london is transport for london which ken is the boss of, im guessing as a lorry driver you dont have as much experience of the underground and buses in london as others,  London underground is a fucking joke, everyday is a chore because of the tube, i hate TFL more than i hate waking up, and im not a morning person   also i think ken is fiddling the books, an alcoholic and he is using schemes like free transport for kids who are approaching voting age to get votes,   that scheme has just popped up out of nowhere around election time and watch it will disappear too,  im pretty sure that 'in the spirit of promoting democracy'Â the mayors office will organise trips to the ballots for all these free transport kids   .......... IN THE MEANTIME CUNTS LIKE ME HAVE TO PICK UP THE BILL AND GET CHARGED EXTRA WHEN THE OYSTER MACHINE LETS US THROUGH BUT DOESNT SCAN OUR CARD PROPERLY  IF YOU WANT TO COMPLAIN YOU NEED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH SOME COMPANY OUT OF LONDON WHO DONT EVEN REPLY TO YOU   thats kens London     i would like to re-clariffy i do not support boris, i prob wont vote for him,    i would like you to show me some proof that he is a racist   its quite funny you say that as it was mayor livingstone who got suspended and had to get an appeal whitewash after comparing a JEWISH JOURNALIST TO A NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP GUARD    Plus, socialism is a con, it makes the working man think it is looking out for him, but just keeps him happy at the bottom of the ladder, rather than give him the oppotunity to get more from life</body>
