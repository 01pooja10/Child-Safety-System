 <body>   It means the end of the era that gave The Patriot Act, Torturing of prisoners, and The Military Commissions act has officially ended. The rights of citizens will be placed in the hands to those whom it originally belonged, the American. That justice for all walks of life will be sought, even for those who most do not agree with, the homosexual, the atheist, the Muslim, the Black, the Hispanic, and all other forms of minority justice will prevail under the harsh punitive injustices of the Christian White majority. That the poor elderly will no longer suffer under the unfulfillable greed of insurance or hospital HMO's. That the dream of Americanism has now been given to those willing to work for it, and not in the hands of the Fortune 500 executives. Prosperity, growth, and equality have been returned to the great justice that is the USA.  No more religious oppression, no more religious division, no more governmental failures of misunderstanding. Tonight, America has joined together and spoke with one monstrous roar, that equality doesn't just stop at law. Shed America has of it's racial shell, it's religious shell, and regrets of mistakes of slavery long past.</body>

 <body>Is that a rhetorical question? Jesus? No, I don't believe in such fantasies, I have no time. Obama represents a complete civil success. Obama is a revolution that empowers people, dreams, and ideas.</body>
