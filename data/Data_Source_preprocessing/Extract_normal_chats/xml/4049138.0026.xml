 <body>The gunfight in the graveyard at the end of THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY.  But that's not the end yet. Then Clint phucks with Tuco with the noose, the cross, the gold, and then "Hey, Blonde! You know what you are?".  Classic hands down-</body>

 <body>The original "The Wicker Man"   THE 1973 ORIGINAL VERSION NOT the Remake.     I didn't see the remake but Im going to assume this was the ending:  Nicholas Cage jumps out of the wicker man at the last moment that its burning, performs Krag Maga on the village leader and several of the other pagans, disarming his gun taking it and grabbing the girl, Nick C. then gets into a car for a long car chase sequence with villagers in pursuit in their cars, with a hail of bullets following him, he crashes through a random fruit stand. Drives under a semi-truck, turning the car into a convertable, the cars following him crash into it. Then he slams into a firetruck which explodes. It seems like all is lost as the pagans surround a bruised and tattered and burned Nick Cage trapped in his car. Then the sound of helicopter blades:  Miraculously the ATF shows up in helicopters. ATF paratroupers leap out on rope ladders. The ATF burns the entire town to the ground like Waco. At the end of the movie a battlescarred Nickolas Cage, exhausted out of breath, gets praised by the leading ATF Commander (who is also Nick's dad) something like "Good job son, sorry I doubted you in Waco"   Then the credits roll, and some lame rap music plays with these lyrics: "Wicka, wicka, wicka; my n$gga, n$gga, n$gga"</body>
