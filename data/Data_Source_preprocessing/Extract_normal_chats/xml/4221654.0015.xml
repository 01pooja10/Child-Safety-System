 <body>  Subprime lending was at its height from 2004 to 2006 (hint: this was where the problem lies) - at the height of this, 84% of these bad loans were not made by Fannie and Freddie. Pretty simple math my man.</body>

 <body> Gotcha. I would like to sit down and talk with a lender who has done that. I would like to know their thought process and see if they really thought they were helping low-income families afford a home or if they knew it would all blow up, but hoping they would be off the ship before the family defaulted.</body>

 <body>Have you not read what I have been writing.  Just because 84% of these bad loans were not made by Fannie or Freddie does not mean that Fannie or Freddie did not come to own these loans.  The problem is NOT where the loan originated but the problem IS where the mortgage ended up. These loans were made in the private sector and then came to be owned by Fannie and Freddie.</body>

 <body>  You need to show that they did in order for me to be concerned... I don't jump to conclusions without evidence.</body>

 <body>well from your article  "Fannie, the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., don't lend money, to minorities or anyone else, however. They purchase loans from the private lenders who actually underwrite the loans."  -like I've been saying.  combine that with:  "Fannie and Freddie went from holding a high of 48 percent of the subprime loans that were sold into the secondary market to holding about 24 percent"  -which i earlier explained is a huge amount of risky debt to hold. Especially if you're bundling all these mortgages together and selling them off as bonds. Fannie and Freddie were whats known as GSE's (government sponsored enterprise). A problem with GSE's is that many investors like AIG, Lehman Brothers, China, banks, etc. view debt issued by GSE's as risk free because they think the government wont allow the debt to default. Essentially, GSE debt ended up being viewed as Treasury debt with higher return and the same risk. Turns out that wasn't the case now all this debt issued by GSE's has questionable value and its making everything go to shit.  In the end it looks like your article was written by somebody who doesn't know how this whole system works.</body>

 <body>Obviously, you have no idea how the mortgage markets worked. What benefit would it be for Joe Lender to hold on to a loan he knows will go bad? Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac acting as intermediaries between the lenders and the overall secondary mortgage market facilitated this entire situation.  The article itself says that 24% of Fannie and Freddie's assets were subprime. Percents are ratios. 84% of the total sub prime loans made is not calculated from the same total number that 24% was derived from.  Do you need proof that Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages and sell them on the secondary market?  Here from Fannie Mae's website, "Fannie Mae operates in the U.S. secondary mortgage market. Rather than making home loans directly with consumers, we work with mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners to help ensure they have funds to lend to home buyers at affordable rates. We fund our mortgage investments primarily by issuing debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets."  I can't find an actual figure stating how much of these private sector loans were actually sold to Fannie and Freddie. However, citing that Fannie doesn't make direct home loans to consumers they had to buy their sub prime holdings from somewhere. My guess is the private sector since thats where the mortgage bankers, brokers, and other primary mortgage market partners reside.</body>

 <body>You've proved nothing. You've made an assumption and jumped to a conclusion without evidence.... and that is all.</body>

 <body>So you're claiming the secondary mortgage market has nothing to do with this mess?</body>
