      <body>  I think the precedent is obvious. Don't do capital crime. It's not that hard to understand.</body>

      <body>I read that story this morning.... I might, just might, understand if the accused had been here a short time, but this fella came to America when he was 3, has been here 30 years. I'm quite sure, he does not need a Mexican consulate explaining to him our laws.</body>

      <body>That piece of filth got what he deserved! All these far-lefft loons have gone crazy, they care more about the killer than about the victim. They will never remember the two girls he raped and killed.</body>

      <body>I don't know what disgusts me more...  The fact that the bastard raped those two girls, the fact that he hypocritcally preached against hatred (he deserved it for what he did to those poor girls), or the fact that the Mexican government is basically endorsing his crimes.  Hear me illegal aliens, look, if you're so determined why don't you overthrow the assholes in charge of Mexico and make it a better place to live? Or do you condone these heinous actions yourself?  Seriously anyone who defends these bastards should themselves be put in jail. He is just lucky I wasn't there. He meaning both the rapist and the government official.</body>

      <body>"nobody has the right to take another..."  He took TWO lives! TWO! And here he is saying that his cousin is worth more than the two girls he strangled and violated?  Sorry the statement of the cousin just pissed me off enough to warrant its own rant.</body>

      <body>"Texas executed Medellin, 33, late Tuesday for the 1993 rape and killing of two teenage girls in Houston."  "The Mexican government statement said officials 'were concerned for the precedent that (the execution) may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained in that country.' "  A couple of points: 1) why did it take 15 years to off this pond scum?Â  2) If Mexico is soooooooooooooo concerned about the treatment of their citizens in the USA, why don't they stop encouraging them to come here?</body>

      <body>  I'd also like to point out that government execution is not a matter of one man deciding to take the life of another man. It is by the LAW that this waste of space was executed.Â  The LAW DOES have the right.</body>

      <body>Everyone seems to be missing the point here. By deliberately renouncing the Vienna Convention, U.S. citizens abroad no longer have a right to request consular assistance. The world is fully cognoscente that the word of the United States on an international treaty is now worthless.</body>

      <body>  I call Bullshit. Americans are held responsible to the laws of other countries, always have been, always will be. Don't think so? Go spit on the sidewalk in Singapore, see what happens.</body>
