 <body>   first of all we really don't have any constitutional "right" to vote for who is president in this country. the problem is that states (willingly) have lost their control and power over to the feds.</body>

 <body>   that's what the 10th amendment is.  if you are inferring a true democracy, then you are a fool to think that is an effective form of "mob rule" government.</body>

 <body>    I want a direct democracy. Community makes the decisions and there is no authority. Sounds like a good plan to me. It is the only form of government that I can support as the people would actually get what they want.</body>

 <body>   Justin, that's a really poor idea. I've got to run out but when I get back I'll explain why if no one else has in the meantime.</body>
