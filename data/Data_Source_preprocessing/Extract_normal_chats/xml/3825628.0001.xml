 <body>I guess he's too liberal for them, like Peter Pace, whose term - one of the shortest in history - as chairman of the joint chiefs, ended soon after he argued that evidence of Iranian military hardware in Iraq is not evidence of their state sanction, at least not at the highest levels. that apparently, didn't go over well at the neocon nerve center (pentagon).</body>

 <body>they don't like to be contradicted. that's been clear since day 1 and is probably why 9/11 happened as well...due to their stubborness and idiocy.  fallon may well be, as one of the articles below delves into, the only man standing between us and full out world war.

 <body>In his statement, Fallon said: "Recent press reports suggesting a disconnect between my views and the President's policy objectives have become distraction at a critical time and hamper efforts in the Centcom region."  "And although I don't believe there have ever been any differences about the objectives of our policy in the Central Command Area of Responsibility, the simple perception that there is makes it difficult for me to effectively serve America's interests there," he said.</body>

 <body> An Admiral Takes on the White House By Gareth Porter Go to Original Washington - A new article on CENTCOM commander Adm. William Fallonconfirms that his public statements last fall ruling out war againstIran last fall were not coordinated with the White House and landed himin trouble more than once with President George W. Bush and VicePresident Dick Cheney. In anadmiring article on Fallon in Esquire, former Pentagon official ThomasP.M. Barnett writes that Fallon angered the White House by "brazenlychallenging" Bush on his aggressive threat of war against Tehran.Barnett also cites "well-placed observers" as saying Bush may soonreplace Fallon with a "more pliable" commander. Barnett's account, which quotes conversations with Fallon during theCENTCOM commander's trips to the Middle East, shows that Fallonprivately justified his statements contradicting the Bush policy ofkeeping the "option" of an unprovoked attack on Iran "on the table" asnecessary to calm the fears of Egypt and other friendly Arab regimes ofa US-Iran war. Barnett recalls thatwhen Fallon was in Cairo in November, the lead story in that day'sedition of the English-language daily Egyptian Gazette carried theheadline "US Rules Out Strike against Iran" over a picture of Fallonmeeting with President Hosni Mubarak. That story, published Nov. 19 and not picked up by any US news media,reported that Fallon had "ruled out a possible strike against Iran andsaid Washington was mulling nonmilitary options instead." Later that day, according to Barnett, Fallon told him during a coffeebreak in a military meeting, "I'm in hot water again," and thenconfirmed that his problems were directly with the White House. That was the second time in less than a week and the third time inseven weeks that Fallon had publicly declared that there would be nowar against Iran. In an interview with Al-Jazeera television inSeptember, which Fallon himself had requested, according to a source atAl-Jazeera, he had said, "This constant drum beat of conflict is whatstrikes me which is not helpful and not useful." And only a week before the trip to Egypt, in an interview withFinancial Times, Fallon had said, a military strike was not "in theoffing," adding, "Another war is just not where we want to go." These statements represented an extraordinary exercise of power by acombat commander, because it contradicted a central feature of theBush-Cheney strategy on Iran. High-ranking Bush administrationofficials had been routinely repeating the administration's line thatno option had been taken "off the table" since early 2005. At an Oct. 17 news conference, Bush said he had "told people that ifyou're interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought tobe interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary tomake a nuclear weapon." Fallon'spublic statements explicitly ruling out an attack on Iran thusundermined the Bush administration's threat against Iran. The willingness of the top commander in the Middle East to take themilitary option "off the table" was in part a reflection of thedetermination of uniformed military leaders to prevent what theyregarded as a disastrous course. Thenew chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, whoreplaced Gen. Peter Pace in June, was even more candid about hisopposition to the use of force against Iran than Pace had been,according to a Congressional staffer who had participated in privatemeetings with both. Pace declared publicly in late October, "We have tobe mindful of the risks that would [be spawned] by engaging in a thirdconflict" in the region. Mullen added, however, that military options "cannot be taken off the table." But Fallon, as the commander responsible for the entire Middle East,was concerned about more than the consequences of actually exercisingthe military option. He was prompted to enunciate a "no-war" line onIran by the panicky reactions of Arab states to what they thought wereindications of the warlike intentions of Bush administration. In the latter half of 2007 friendly Arab regimes were upset by thepossibility of a US-Iran war, which they feared would destabilize theentire region. Fallon is quoted as telling Barnett, "[I]t's all anyonewants to talk about right now. People here hear what I'm saying andunderstand. I don't want to get them too spun up." Fallon told Barnett that his ruling out of military action against Iranwas necessary to calm the very regimes the Bush administration washoping to enlist to support its anti-Iran line. "Washington interpretsthis as all aimed at them," Fallon said in Cairo, according to Barnett."Instead, it's aimed at governments and media in this region. I'm nottalking about the White House." Fallon was arguing, in effect, that it makes no sense to make thepossibility of an unprovoked attack part of your declaratory policy ifmerely induces confusion and panic among friendly governments withoutinfluencing the target of the threat. Barnett quotes Fallon as complaining that "they" - meaning White Houseofficials - were asking him, "Why are you even meeting with Mubarak?"But Fallon strongly defended the diplomatic role he was playing inrelations with Mubarak and other Middle Eastern leaders. "This is mycenter of gravity," Fallon told him. "This is my job." Fallon's sensitivity to the political-diplomatic consequences of adeclaratory policy that explicitly keeps open the threat of anaggressive war as a potential option set him apart not only from theWhite House but from the consensus among national security specialistsin both parties. In early 2007, all three of the top three Democraticcontenders for the presidential nomination publicly declared theirsupport for keeping "all options on the table." Fallon is not the first CENTCOM commander to rein in aggressive WhiteHouse policy toward the Middle East. In late 1997, according to DanaPriest's book, The Mission, the Bill Clinton White House wanted CENTCOMcommander Gen. Anthony Zinni to order his pilots to provoke a militaryconfrontation with Iraq in the no-fly zone by deliberately drawing firefrom Iraqi planes. The request forsuch a provocation was conveyed to Zinni by the vice chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Ralston. But Zinni, who believed thatit could lead to an unwanted war with Iraq, insisted that a formalrequest from the White House would have to be sent, and the plan wasdropped. The unhappiness of the Bushadministration with Fallon's role as well as the unflattering pictureof administration policy revealed by the article was evident Thursdayfrom the failure of either the White House or the Pentagon to issue theusual reassuring statements in response to the article. The White House declined to comment, although, according to theWashington Post's Thomas Ricks, the article "was being discussedthere." The Pentagon spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said Secretary ofDefense Robert M. Gates "has read the profile on Admiral Fallon butchooses not to comment on it or other press accounts."</body>
