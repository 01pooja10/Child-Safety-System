      <body>To your question I will just say that the one year that I did not vote Bush won, and in him winning oil prices soared, healthcare, insurance, food prices soared as well. Secondly, It is best that I try to get people in office who will best represent me and the choices I make in life in addition to the lifestyle I choose to keep. I also have a huge fear that if we choose to not be the deciding factors in the candidacy for presidency, then someone else will. Would you feel safe giving that responsibility to any one group in America? Please make your vote count. Consider the most important things in life to you and vote for the person who will most likely help you keep those things close to home. K</body>

      <body> #1. It's called freedom of speech. #2.Ã&#130;Â  If I vote for a candidate and he turns into a huge douchebag do I still have grounds to complain? (e.g. Bush) #3.Ã&#130;Â  If you think every candidate sucks ass and none of them are worthy of your vote you get more respect from me than if you vote for the person that sucks the least [out of the top 2 parties because you think a 3rd party vote is a wasted vote]. #4.Ã&#130;Â  They're taking your money, they're running your lives.Ã&#130;Â  You ALWAYS have the right to complain.</body>

      <body>  WINNAR.  To address another point, if voting is a right, why do I have to register to do so?  In that regard, driving or getting married is a right.Ã&#130;Â  I should just be able to walk in and do it when I feel like it.  I'm not up for lesser of two evils garbage, either.Ã&#130;Â  16 years of crap for candidates ought to have taught everyone that a vote for a shitty candidate is...validation of a shitty candidate.  That is how the campaigns looks at it.  The End.</body>

      <body>  The problem with using popular voting as a definitive method of making decisions about representatives. . .is that the popular vote is VERY easy to f*ck with. Given the motivation, it's really simple for someone to submit dozens of ballots using a falsified identity with each one. Since it's effectively illegal to make people provide identification when voting(and I agree with this, btw), it's makes for very skewed elections. Of course, that might not happen every time. . .but why take the risk?  I'm not saying that I agree with the Electoral College, either, since it has its own flaws. A new system should be created that does a better job at giving people a say in their government, and in the selection of representatives.</body>
