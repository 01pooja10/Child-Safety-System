 <body>no problem, I'll give you two Carbon Copy and Virtuosity.    I am not even going to get into his newer stuff because he is just an angry black man. Like I said, as much range as Bruce Willis, no matter what he does, its Bruce Willis. No matter what Denzel does, its just Denzel. Not hating on the guy, just call it as I see it.    As a person, he is a good fella. A buddy of mine has worked with him a few times, most recently on Deja Vu. Denzel can play a practical joke and take one as well. Not easily said for the likes of Tom Cruise.</body>

 <body>It takes talent to remember lines but for acting gigs Denzel desperatly needs to expand his horizons away from the angry black man with a smirk. A great actor can bring a character to life where nobody else could. In other words, you can not imagine anyone else in the role such as Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.      as far as my two picks of bad films being invalid, nope, you asked for one I gave you two, lol.</body>

 <body>    That's what I was thinking. That doesn't make any damn sense. Plus Bond fans would be pissed. Hell, I'm not even a Bond fan and I'd still be pissed.</body>

 <body>    How about that James Bond is white?    A black James Bond wouldn't work. A spy film with a black guy in it would, but James Bond is white. You might as well make James Bond a transexual with one leg as well. And set it in 13th Century Wales. It's the same as all those idiots wanting a woman to play Doctor Who-it would feel 'wrong'.</body>

 <body>Obviously you didnt read what I wrote, it was an example.  Can you imagine Indiana Jones played by anyone other than Harrison Ford. Can you imagine Indy played by Tom Sellick because thats who the part was written as and for, Magnum PI. Harrison Ford is the last great classic action star no doubt about it.    As far as Training Day, anyone pretty much could step right into that role. Yes I have seen it and still to this day wonder why anyone can see it as a great film. Ethan Hawk is a great actor? When did this happen? Not sure we watched the same film or is it the age gap?    Malcolm X,  You first need to realise and understand, was a real person. All you need to do with when portraying a real person is impersonate them. There is plenty of footage of the real person to study from. He did not create a character, he impersonated a person. Maybe its just me but there is enough drama in real life to sit down and watch someone else's drama on film. I tried watching Malcolm X and just couldnt do it, boring and just uninteresting to me personaly but o each their own.    Pretty much any actor will tell you, drama is easy, comedy is hard.</body>
