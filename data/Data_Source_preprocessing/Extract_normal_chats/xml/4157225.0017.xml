 <body>  It's quite amazing how rude some people can be.  My first post said "Discuss" with the title asking a question, not making a statement. If I made a blatant statement then that would warrant your abuse, which is quite easy to dish out considering you've got a computer to hide behind.  I would carry this on but knowing how people behave online you'll most probably either...  1) Make some trashy comment based on insults that can't be backed up.  2) Start twisting my words round so it makes out I've meant something else.  3) Just play dumb and pretend you don't understand what I said even though you did. All because you can't think of a response that doesn't feature the 3 usual responses I've listed here.  It's all predictable.  LOL.</body>

 <body>Or maybe the 4th option which is to change the subject entirely.  Interesting you mention it though. Yep, until now I did know LOL but not GTFO. But then again I know the Spanish for "Hello", but without knowing the whole Spanish language.</body>

 <body>To answer the question... based on the map posted in the thread it's obvious the southeast is not receiving the same percentage of taxes. I'm guessing that the southeast financially speaking is wealthier than the northern parts. It is fashionable for wealthy people to donate to charities. It is possible that whatever taxes they have less of in comparison with the other parts are compensated for by people donated to various charities such as privately funded soup kitchens and other things of that nature. Now in saying all that I said I was not implying that all public services are necessarily necessary and in writing what was just written previously in this sentence I was not saying whether or not I disagree with various public services being funded.</body>

 <body>  My thought is why did you have to say GTFO. Could you not simply talk to me instead of insult me?  Sheltered background? You really know nothing about me, do you?</body>

 <body>  GTFO is still telling people where to go which is pretty disrespectful.</body>
