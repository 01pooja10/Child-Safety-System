      <body>Did Josh study history books of Ulysses S. Grant and Warren G. Harding like W did on the subject of "unbelievably inept and abominable attempts of some men to completely f*ck up an entire nation as president" ?</body>

      <body>   No. And the word you should have used was independent. 'liberal' is a word for people who don't know who or why or what they're so angry for.</body>

      <body>  Hey, whadaya mean, f*ck up an entire nation? He's just living the american dream! You know, financing two wars with credit cards from china! For as much as has been spent in the wars, is how much the US will have to pay back to china, plus interest. This isn't pinko liberal faggity talk. This is money talk. Some dumbass who got the pulitzer prize in economics wrote a book saying this war is going to cost at least 3 trillion dollars (trillion is a word liberals like to use, 3 syllables). anyway, china will own the US, and bush still doesn't own Iraq, and the US soldiers who don't own their arms or legs or brains will be cared for, until they die, and that bill hasn't even started to come in yet. Wow, sounds like this could be a very interesting movie! Can't wait! I wonder if it will be as sick as the real thing.</body>

      <body>   whoops, responded to the wrong post. anyway, I'm curious to see what stone will do with the material recent history has presented him, and hopefully will stir intelligent debate, rather than the shouting and name calling that is passed off as political discourse on FUX and CNN.</body>

      <body> Ah, so i bet you believe that Roosevelt had absolutely NO idea about Pearl harbor huh?  not saying Bush did or didn't have anything to do with his daddy's enemy for whom till this day we have no caught nor went after...  Also did we ever find the WMDs? you know the ones that were in the country that had Nothing to do with 9/11?  point is, You DON'T know he didn't just as we don't know he did, cause you are not in the office to know what goes on in the lying politicians doors..  THEY ALL LIE, so how do you even know what to believe?  he has his right to say Bush may have planned it, but in term you call him a name for his opinion, thats very American, no wonder why other countries hate us, hell we can't even like nor respect each other...unless we are being blown up</body>
