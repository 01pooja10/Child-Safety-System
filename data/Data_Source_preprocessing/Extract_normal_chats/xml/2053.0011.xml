      <body>I know a couple people that go there and they say its easy as shit, but its really hard to get out of there in 4 years because of how hard it is to get the classes you need for your major.</body>

      <body>For those who complain about not being able to meet people or it's like high school, then they should really put themselves out there to meet new people. I've been at Long Beach State for 4 years now and I have tons of school spirit, more friends than I could count, met hundreds of hot girls, partied like there was no tomorrow, and taken some of the most thought provoking classes that makes you really think about life.  College is about being on your own and having freedom, it's not about sticking to your old high school buddies because it's comfortable or cuz you're too much of a pussy to get out there and make something happen for yourself. Like the saying goes, "GO BEACH OR GO HOME!!!"</body>

      <body>Damn little freshman. The Beach is where it's at. You're probably not having a good time and think it's too much like high school cuz you're only stickin too your little high school friends. You're in college now, get out there and meet people! In other words...grow up!</body>

      <body>I just transferred here from OCC in Fall 2004. I think the people and the professors are really great. But what do you guys mean by "put yourself out there"? I'm a commuter and I work so I find it hard to meet ppl. (I just go to class then leave cause I have to get to work). I just bought a condo so I can't exactly move to LB. Also, I find it really hard to meet ppl my age: everyone's either young or old. I want to make some friends so HELP! Send me a message if you can/want.    Thanks guys</body>
