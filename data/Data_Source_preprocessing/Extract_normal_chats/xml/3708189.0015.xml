 <body>maybe true,   but if you had to payÂ 30 quidÂ a week out of your own wages to get transport that was usually either late, overcrowded, disrupted or dangerous, you would be a lot more concerned with who runs it and how much they charge  if i got something for free, i would be satisfied with any standard of service as it hasnt cost me anything  by giving youÂ free transport ken is effectively trying to buy off the next generation of voters who are more likely to vote than someone with a fulltime job and family and commitments, and giving the bill to the rest of us,  for every free student transport pass, that is 1500 quid a year roughly he is adding onto the rest of londons travel costs  you will spend more of your life paying full price than on childrens free pass, will u still be as grateful when your 30yrs oldÂ and having to pay up to 40 or 50 a week on travel costs because more and more potential voters get free travel passes and you have to pay the bill?   there is no real need for teenagers to have free transport, non   old people, disabled people yes   young people no,  i agree with discounted travel for the young, but free..... thats taking the piss and shameless aimed at getting new voters    </body>

 <body>In my area of East Yorkshire, I don't think we have a BNP candidate.  I would vote for them in the next election though, as a protest against all the scum they are letting into the country.Â  Britain is full.Â  No more please.</body>
