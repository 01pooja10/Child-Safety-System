 <body>Thomas Jane as The Punisher. I can't wait to see the next one.    But Bale was awesome as well as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I can't wait to see him add some more layers in the next film.</body>

 <body>    its the flaws that make a hero super. They find a way to help people no matter what is going on in their lives...self sacrifice. That's what makes a hero super. No matter what, they help those who are more and less fortunate than them. If they were all invincible, what fun would it be? It would all be the same. Bad guy threatens city, good guy gets bad guy without getting scratched...end of story. That would be a sucky movie.</body>
