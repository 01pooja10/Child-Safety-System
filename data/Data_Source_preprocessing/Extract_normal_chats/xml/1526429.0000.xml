 <body>I thought The Shining was a good movie, not the best but good. Scatman Crothers was the main reason why I've seen the movie.</body>

 <body>the shining is class, did you notice that nicholsons wife in the film was a really bad actress, i think if they hadnt used such a strong actor as nicholson the film would have bombed.</body>

 <body>What makes the book so scary is Jack's slow descent into madness but a major flaw with the film is that Jack starts off as already crazy. When he smiles that famous grin with the crooked eye-brow we already know he's nuts. It takes the terror out of Jack's slow mental breakdown.</body>
