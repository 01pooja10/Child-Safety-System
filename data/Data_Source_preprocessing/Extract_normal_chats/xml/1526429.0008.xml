 <body>What makes the book so scary is Jack's slow descent into madness but a major flaw with the film is that Jack starts off as already crazy. When he smiles that famous grin with the crooked eye-brow we already know he's nuts. It takes the terror out of Jack's slow mental breakdown.</body>

 <body>It's a classic movie and the hotel it is based on (The Stanley Hotel) is really supposed to be haunted. My wife and I almost crashed off the road driving by it in the middle of a snow storm. At the time of the near accident, I was kidding around saying, "I'm coming for you Danny boy!" Ever since then I've been prohibited from doing impersonations while driving.</body>

 <body>Fuckin' CLASSIC, despite what Stephen King says. Shelly Duvall is not a pretty woman but her performance exemplary. Nicholson was great, before this act of his became cliched (Batman, Witches of Eastwick).  What a creepy cast of ghouls! Philip Stone, Joe Turkel and those friggin' twins.  Oh, and let's not forget the old bag in the tub!</body>

 <body>Excellent film. Infact it was on t.v. last night and I watched it again, one of Kubrick's best films.</body>

 <body>    I prefer the movie to the book - animated bestial hedges are not scary, and Jack Nicholson's so good in the role. And that guy what plays the waiter-cum-Delbert O'Grady. The toilet scene is eerie in the book too, mind.</body>
