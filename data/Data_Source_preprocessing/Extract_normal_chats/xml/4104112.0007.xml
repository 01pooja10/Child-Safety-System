 <body>you can't judge the US as a WHOLE just because some bimbos asked you questions that were dumb. Its very critical of you to do that. Not everyone is like that. its like when the French people call Americans pigs. Not everyone is the same.</body>

 <body>That was me asking the queen question but I think you mis-understood ..  I was asking if you ARE a queen .  I mean you were like the ONLY guy in the bar who didn't go home with at least 1 girl.  What a donk.</body>
