 <body>  The Constitution doesn't give any president the power to rule the world.Â  That's true as well.Â  As for his opinions, a lot of them are favorable on the world stage.</body>

 <body>Yes, despite all the aid the US gives out, which - by the way - is done on purpose as a bureacratic tool to get them to rely on us, they don't like us - and they want us out.  Popular world vote does NOT like the US policing the world, and despite how they act when we give them aid etc, it makes them rely on us, and in reality makes them despise us more. It's all about the pecking order, and the side effects of reliance - as opposed to independents. This also gets "misconstrued" as a forced feeling of inferiority, which is also unliked.  This is the general world opinion of the US.  Lets get the hell out, it will benefit everyone involved in the long run.</body>

 <body>   Tell that to the United Nations. A HUGE majority of the relief and peacekeeping missions we are on, worldwide, are the result of UN mandate.  Do some research instead of spewing Ron Paul blogs.</body>

 <body>Yay, more strawman arguments.  And spewing Ron Paul blogs?  Uhmmmm... buddy, despite what the UN is and does (which, in case you didnt know, is a multi-national collaborative entity BTW and is not made up solely of the US), that doesn't discredit the world's general opinion about the US.  Especially when the UN says, "No, you can't invade iraq", and the US says "Too bad, what are you going to do?" Sicne that IS basically how it went down.  The US government does what it wants, regardless of what the UN wants. The US only "abides" by the UN when it's convenient for them. It's a big fucking joke. So don't try and back the US and opinion with the collaborative effors of the UN - because then you just end up looking like a complete jackass.</body>

 <body>A big tax cut for the rich would give them more money to invest.... in China.  The days of the wealthiest Americans investing in America are over; now they outsource as much as they can and buy foreign jets, cars, clothes, shoes, etc, to boot....  An internationalist (and indeed any true liberal) should approve, since their actions combined with our debt policy is effecting a massive shift of US resources to the masses of China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc.... while another chunk of our wealth is going to Iran, the Saudis, Venezuela, Nigeria, and everyone else who produces oil (oh yeah, and they're spending that oil wealth on goods made in Europe and Asia too)....</body>
