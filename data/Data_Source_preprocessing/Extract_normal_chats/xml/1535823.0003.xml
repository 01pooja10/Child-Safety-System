 <body>    I quite agree, this is the one explanation I heard and thought- that's it! That's what I think it is.    Backed up, of course, by the plaster, or, 'Band Aid' that's on the back of his neck, which legend says is where the Devil would pull the soul from...    Something like that anyways!</body>

 <body>I heard a theory that its tinkerbell. Apparantly Disney and whichever studio did pulp fiction (cant remember right now) had a friendly understanding in which they would promote each others films in their own. Or something like that.    Cant remember where I read it or how valid it is but it would be cool if it was true!</body>

 <body>If I had to guess, I'd say it was a suitcase full of laundered money, hence the "my boss' dirty laundry." But then again I take everything literally, so it's probably not it.</body>

 <body>It was Marcellus' soul which could be considered his "dirty laundry". Plus that is why they made sure you saw the bandaid on the back of his neck.</body>
