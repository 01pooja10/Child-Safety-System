 <body>I heard a theory that its tinkerbell. Apparantly Disney and whichever studio did pulp fiction (cant remember right now) had a friendly understanding in which they would promote each others films in their own. Or something like that.    Cant remember where I read it or how valid it is but it would be cool if it was true!</body>

 <body>If I had to guess, I'd say it was a suitcase full of laundered money, hence the "my boss' dirty laundry." But then again I take everything literally, so it's probably not it.</body>

 <body>It was Marcellus' soul which could be considered his "dirty laundry". Plus that is why they made sure you saw the bandaid on the back of his neck.</body>

 <body>Yes, thaaat's realistic. Two gangsters risk it all to return life essence to their boss?! Where do you people think it up.    Come on, if anything, we are led to assume that it's either cash [the dirty laundry line] or something else of high monetary value that would be worth it.  Don't try and interpret Pulp Fiction of all films as a fantasy/sci-fi movie.</body>

 <body>    Its Quentin Tarrantino for God's sake! Since when are his films the norm? Besides that was out of his mouth, not a guess on anyone's part.</body>

 <body>I can't beleive people are still talking about this.... well my theroies... Tarantino was once quizzed about the plaster/band-aid on the back of is neck, he responded by saying that Ving Rhames (Marselius Wallace) has a scar on the back of his neck, it was thought that this would be too distracting as he's a perfectionist and wanted the shot from the back of his head. Whoever made up the Devil-Removing-soul-from-back-of-next-(fact) is laughing his fucking ass of, because that has never been said in ANY documented writtings about Beelezebub (that i've found, feel free to correct me).  As for the contents of the case... Elvis's Gold Suit. Featured in Tarantino's True Romance (i know i know he only wrote it, don't feel free to correct me). Okay so i don't have much in the way of proof but this is Tarantino's quest he creates questions so people keep on talking about it for years to come. Like we're doing now.      Why is Reservoir Dogs called Reservoir Dogs?    I therefore rest my case m'lord.    Be Cool.</body>
