      <body>  Ã&#130;Â  The 'problem' in this case would be that of Americans placing their asses across our border. We need to shut our border with the USA, and the rest of the world.</body>

      <body>  Ã&#130;Â  No, even our libtard government wanted them to leave. It was their equally libtarded voters who demanded the cowards be allowed to remain on my soil.</body>

      <body>  Ã&#130;Â  I neither want your deserters, nor your Mexicans. The moment Mexicans start to trickle through our border, I suggest it is time to retrieve our troops from Afghanistan, and have them shoot any of the fuckers attempting to make the mess of our country that they have of yours. Not going to happen on my watch. I am already working towards getting Muslims booted out of Canada since a few of their own were spying on one of our nuclear power plants with the sole intention of bombing it.</body>

      <body>  Ã&#130;Â  Why? He's a libtard who claims to be conservative. He is nowhere near such a thing. The man is clearly a socialist bitch. I want no part of him. Strangely enough, he is member of the ruling Conservative Party of Canada.</body>

      <body>  Did you know that the first wave of draft deserters during the Vietnam War that settled in Canada shifted the country's politcs a few odd points left.  Granted, the times and demographics are different and the number of deserters is a miniscule fraction of the first wave but after the Babylonian clusterfuck (Iraq War) is done away with, it'll be interesting to see how many draft-dodgers choose to stay in Canada.  Also, if they'll ever be pardoned for deserting like what Carter did after Nam.</body>

      <body>  Ã&#130;Â  Absolutely untrue. Canada was leftist long before the arrival of Vietnam War draft dodgers. Canada was barely aware of socialism until American 'farmers' moved into Canada to get away from growing conservatism in the USA. Canada has become 'leftist' thanks to the import of Americans, but not draft-dodgers. The reason the draft-dodgers were even allowed to stay would be thanks to the fact Canada was already leftist. Their presence did nothing to Canadian politics. Canadians were being called 'commies' long before the Vietnam War.</body>

      <body>   I agree with the premise, but think about this for a second...  If your commander-in-chief is more than willing to toss you (you = the average deserter) in the brig on a whim any time an Iraqi cries "wolf" without so much as a trial...Haditha comes to mind.</body>
