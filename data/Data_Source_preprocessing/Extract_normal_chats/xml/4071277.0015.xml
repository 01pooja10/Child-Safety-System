 <body>  Lawyers get paid to tell lies.  Yes, I admit all all lawyers arent jonny cochran, but still. They knowingly portray reality under a false microscope, and sometimes its deadly...</body>

 <body>  So very true. The language they use is pretty much foreign to probably about 90% of us. Therefore making us equal in the eyes of the law pretty much a out and out lie. Of course ignorance is no excuse, as they say. What gets me is your considered ignorant if your unable to lawyerspeak or speak the tongue of deception.  I've had recent dealings needing a lawyer, That son o bitch ripped me off more than the people I was after. He's 3g's richer and I'm in the exact same situation I was in before he was retained.  I should have handled it the old Irish way, but on the advice of those closest to me, I refrained.  Heh, Maybe I will send that thiefing som bitch a piece of rope and one of those witty Irish quotes and let him think about that not everyone he screw's is going to let it slide, or maybe one day he will turn around and there I'll be, to explain to him about honesty and integrity and when someone charges $300.00 bucks an hour, he damn well better earn it.</body>

 <body>Lawyers are the biggest scumbags to live on this planet, all they care about is there F---ing money They dont care if you go to prison. Why do yuu think most of the people in prison are poor, most of them should be in there but it makes you wonder how many innocent people are there just because the scumbag piece of crap didnt get enuogh money to line his pocket! Then the lump of bile when theyve thoroughly screwed there fellow americans out of everything they have, They somehow think that they are now worthy of representing us as Senetor or Congressman. We dont really even get a choice because chances are both sides of the race are going to be scumbag bile. So thats why we end up with a Congress that has the the worst approvel rating in american history. Most scumbag Lawyers think they are so supperior to the average american that they have no Idea what issues are most important to the people they are supposed to be representing. But they do know how to spend tax money that doesnt belong to them did I mention I hate Lawyers!!!!</body>

 <body> I heard of one "public defender" even showing up DRUNK for a trial! He was do drunk that the judge had to suspend proceedings. Really wonder why these people conduct themselves and treat their indigent clients the way they do.</body>

 <body> You mean a good lawyer, right?  I got my older brother. He's an attorney. Although it would have to deal with real estate. Otherwise, I'm fucked.</body>
