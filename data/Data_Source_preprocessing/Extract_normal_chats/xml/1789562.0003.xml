 <body>Problem with today's superhero movies. Superheroes are invincible, smart, and with out a flaw. Why do we portray them as people with tragic flaws, like Spiderman movies. I mean is a super hero supposed to bitch or cry about MJ? Shouldn't he be out there stopping villains and explaining logic and philosphy to their sidekicks?</body>

 <body>    Well you must've never read a spider-man comic in your life. Spider-man is all about the flaws, that's what makes him a great super hero.    For character portrayal I'd say that Christopher Reeves is top of the list.</body>

 <body>Thomas Jane as The Punisher. I can't wait to see the next one.    But Bale was awesome as well as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I can't wait to see him add some more layers in the next film.</body>

 <body>    its the flaws that make a hero super. They find a way to help people no matter what is going on in their lives...self sacrifice. That's what makes a hero super. No matter what, they help those who are more and less fortunate than them. If they were all invincible, what fun would it be? It would all be the same. Bad guy threatens city, good guy gets bad guy without getting scratched...end of story. That would be a sucky movie.</body>
