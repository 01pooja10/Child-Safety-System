      <body>I completely agree! It's not something I hear many people complain about though. Considering electors are theoretically free to vote for the candidate of their choice, which means our vote might not count at all.</body>

      <body>By all means if you don't feel like voting don't do it. I believe a big part of the reason this countries gone to shit is because uninformed people with little interest in politics vote because they feel they have a patriotic duty to do so.</body>

      <body> know how you feel... i had a bumper sticker for awhile that said, "don't blame me, i didn't vote" things that might make me go vote 1. someone runs that i really think represents me 2. "none of the above" actually is counted and has an effect on the election 3. getting rid of the (for presidential elections) the electoral college might get me to register at least 4. noam chomsky running with jello biafra has a chance of me voting 5. some system of accountability put into place so those elected actually have to at least attempt to keep the promises they make during campaigning (maybe if popularity drops below 50% they get booted?)</body>

      <body>People that always vote Democrat or Republican are part of the problem. The people that don't vote have enough sense to know all of their choices suck.</body>
