      <body>Too much of a commuter school...have only met a handful of people there in a year and a half!!! oh well, graduating next month so I guess it doesn't matter!!    But on a good note, they do have an excellent program for those interested in Psychology.</body>

      <body>I think it's by far one of the best schools in the country. The only problem is you have to get yourself involved before it gets good. Have never had a problem making a friend here either.</body>

      <body>Do you guys really not like it there? CSULB is one of my top schools that I'm applying to. My majors fit there, and the location is perfect for me. But is it really not all it's cracked up to be?</body>

      <body>I've found that the people who complain about it being like high school are the same people that went to high school within 25-30 miles of it. That's the problem with a lot of commuter schools, (I grew up near Sacramento State).    I've also found that the people who love it tend to be the one's who get themselves involved. I moved onto campus at CSULB 2 1/2 years ago not knowing a single person -- and now I know plenty of people. I have more friends now than I did in high school and a more active social life for sure. And I was damn busy with my life in high school!        College is what you make it.      Although I will say that the lack of football or other tailgating sport may contribute to the lack of school spirit. But, really, often when I'm out and about wearing CSULB stuff (either in northern or southern california) people will come up and start talking to me about our sports anyway... I just smile and tell them that the sociology and human development are good.</body>
