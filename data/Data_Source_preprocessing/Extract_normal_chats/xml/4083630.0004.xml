 <body> I don't think his death had anything to do with it. The performances of the cast and the execution of the film stands on its own.</body>

 <body>I highly doubt that IMO, hasn't the publicity of Ledgers death come and gone. I mean all I'm hearing now a days is how he did a great job as The Joker, really I haven't once heard anything about his death.</body>

 <body>TDK was better than Begins...I didn't like begins. But I liked TDK...Because of the acting, but I still don't like the Bale over voice acting as Batman.</body>

 <body>  If you really didn't like itÂ  . . . then I can respect that, but you will have to do better than Bale's voice as Batman. ItÂ was an established fact (comic book) that Batman spoke with a gravelly typeÂ voice. If you expected it to be cheesy. . Â then why did you go to the theater to see it. I personally only go to the theater to see movies thatÂ I think are going to be goodÂ  . . all the rest I can wait for DVD.  The fact that you started a thread while there is one pinned . . . just to state your disgust with the film makes you an attention whoreÂ  . . . GOOD JOB !!</body>
