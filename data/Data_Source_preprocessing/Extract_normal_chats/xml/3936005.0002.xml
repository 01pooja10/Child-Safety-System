      <body>  No they will be a load of Hyped Bullocks Garbage  Child's Play could work but what else can they do with it make it more scarier nada, just probably add more gore and CGI  Dragon Ball, do i hear a fan riot for making a white guy, Goku  Friday the 13th being produced by Michael Bay, juss gonna have more gore and under developed character background on Jason Voorhees as for Bay has poor developmental writing skills. Which will also be his flaw when he comes to produced and co-write 'A Nightmare On Elm St (2010).  Tekken automatically fails</body>

      <body>  That's exactly it.  I'm actually kind of curious on Dave's comment.  Remakes equal easy money. Then again, the originals stand to earn money too. Remake comes out, then it makes people want to see the original. According to my list, 2009 stands to be a much bigger year than 2008. Incredible Hulk can suck a fat one. Even though it looks better than the last one, still looks like shit.</body>

      <body>They make crappy movies because you pay to see them. People payed money to see Meet the Spartans, Date movie, Epic Movie, etc... but nobody paid to see There Will Be Blood... so... which movies will the studio continue to produce?</body>
