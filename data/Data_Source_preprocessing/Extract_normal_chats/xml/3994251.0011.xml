      <body>Hey, if that's Canada's stance on this, then that's their business. I don't think this is something that would really be worth taking any sort of international stand on.</body>

      <body>  Â  An American who has decided to keep his nose out of Canada's internal affairs? I'll be blinkered! Well, there is always a first time.</body>

      <body>  Ã&#130;Â  Sweetie, Canada did not welcome them. We originally wanted them gone, until libtard fruitcakes crashed the party and demanded the Canadian government allow them to stay.</body>

      <body>  Hey, if they come back to the States, then throw the book at them. When they're not, it's just not worth fighting with friendly nations about. They're already suffering by not being able to come home to their families, and by being ostracized by everybody who knows them for running off to Canada when things got too rough for them.</body>

      <body>  Ã&#130;Â  The 'problem' in this case would be that of Americans placing their asses across our border. We need to shut our border with the USA, and the rest of the world.</body>
