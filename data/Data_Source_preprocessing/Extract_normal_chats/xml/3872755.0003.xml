      <body>  You are from Russia. I think I want to move there one day. Why live in a country that is changing from freedom to fascism. Why not live in a country where you know your place.</body>

      <body>  I believe a company has a right to make money; however, go over seas for cheap labor is wrong. If it cost more to make your products blame the gov. for inflation, then take action to lower costs by being innovated. To me thats sounds at least fair. Illegal immigrants not wanted. No help is wanted. If you want a job, then apply for a work vista. Do not cheat yourself or life.</body>

      <body>The following are the Justices on the Supreme Court and which president nominated them:  Chief Justice John Roberts - George W. Bush (considered to be more on the conservative end) Associate Justice John Paul Stevens - Gerald Ford (considered to be one of the more liberal members on the court) Associate Justice Antonin Scalia - Ronald Reagan (considered to be the most conservative on the court) Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy - Ronald Reagan (most moderate on the bench) Associate Justice David Souter - George H.W. Bush (votes with the liberal wing) Associate Justice Clarence Thomas - George H.W. Bush (votes with the conservative wing) Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg - Bill Clinton (one of the more liberal voting justices) Associate Justice Stephen Breyer - Bill Clinton (votes with the liberal wing) Associate Justice Samuel Alito - George W. Bush (considered to be more conservative)  Essentially, this is still a split court. You have 4 conservatives (Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito) and 4 liberals (Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer).  And then you have the swing vote in Kennedy.  Now please, explain to me how this Supreme Court is a "Republican controlled Supreme Court."</body>

      <body>  Back in 2000 it was a republican controlled supreme court, which of course changes from time to time. but still the point has been made. why does a suprem power possibly influened by one party or the other party make and decide who is to be in charge of our country. why not a re-vote or a boxing match. or something.</body>

      <body>  K. Now here is my stance on it all. I think if 1 is legal the other has to be. Simply because they are the same thing in concept: cheap labor for an advantage in a market, less input for the same output. I'm not necessarily for both, but i do think that if Companies can go offshore, then companies who can't afford to (Despite the industry) should be able to higher cheap labor.  The problem with socialism is that government controlling wages will lead to lack of effort because of the lack of benefits. Right now, people work hard and continue to work hard to work their way up that ladder, with socialism, you don't get the same kind of purpose, or drive, from the workers. What we have now, isn't a real capitalism because no matter what, the gov't still watches for monopolies and still regulates a base point in wages (minimum wages).  I would prefer a capitalistic market over a socialistic market any day of the week because it benefits the hard working man who strives to climb the ladder.</body>

      <body>  The Supreme Court is completely independent, and was designed that way. The only time that any partisanship has an influence is when the confirmations are taking place.  So tell me, how exactly can any President, party, or politician have ANY influence over a member in the Supreme Court? What can they do? The Justice is nominated for LIFE. What could any party or politician possibly offer to a sitting Supreme Court Justice, when that Justice has a guaranteed job no matter who's in power, and no matter what their decision is?  Think about the 2000 election for a second. What did the Justices who voted to stop the recount (let's remember that the case wasn't about the Supreme Court voting for one candidate or another....if you really think that, please reread the decision) have to gain from doing so? What motive could Justice Scalia and then Chief Justice Rehnquist possibly have in ensuring that one party or another, or one president or another, came to power? Do you know what would have happened to all the sitting "conservative" Justices if Gore had won instead? NOTHING. So how did the party have any influence over their decision?</body>
