 <body>   The whole Kimbo character was fiction to begin with. He's been handled with the utmost of care since he made the switch to mma and became EliteXC's cash cow that appeals to the white, suburban gangster demographic. He was scheduled to fight the corpse of a light heavyweight that hasn't won a fight in close to 10 years. He instead got knocked out by a man that weighed 30 lbs less standing on one foot.  mma.tv has a .gif of Shaw screaming that Kimbo was being hit in the back of the head when Slice was already staring up at the lights. Truly, it has made my day  http://webpages.charter.net/gline/skala-kimbo_seth-juggo.gif</body>

 <body>  i think you meant to say that MMA in general appeals to the white, suburban gangster demographic. UFC knows who their market is. 12 boys living in a house together (TUF), heavy metal music at every juncture, etc, etc.</body>

 <body>I was driving to work in West Austin (the pricey part of town) on Thursday, and I saw a white, TapOut-clad teenaged kid driving a new Escalade on rims with 'Team Hughes' stickers all over the back while basing Tupac.  It was quite possibly the proudest moment of my life. I had witnessed the pinnacle of our civilization.</body>

 <body>im not afraid to admit that I was a fan of slice. i said as soon as Shamrock weighed in at 206.5 that a lighter fighter would be the most dangerous scenario for an inexperienced gorilla like Kimbo. I never had any illusions about him. I thought that at best, he'd have a 10-4 or 12-6 record at 38. Slice has never even had an amateur career and he's going up against guys who've been doing it their entire lives. he was SUPPOSED to be fighting tomato cans. everybody demanded that he fight stiffer competition to justify the personna that Elite XC manufactured or magnified for him. i wasn't a supporter because I bought into that hype. the fight world and entertainment in general has always been plagued by that kind of hypocrisy. good fiction outsells reality in every genre.</body>

 <body>  cant argue with you about that, and to be honest after listening to him talk after the fight, and listening to his interview I think i have more respect for the guy, although i still didnt like the fact that he wouldnt touch gloves. More than anything what i've always disliked about kimbo is his gangster attitude and crew and persona. But again after last night, his humility surprised me. What surprised me even more was the absence of his don king like promoter. perhaps he dropped him, which id respect yet again</body>

 <body>  yeah, it was a good story while it lasted and it was telling that it was a former ufc guy that nailed him in a matter of seconds. this may signal the end of XC.  but his story is not over yet because of the ad hoc nature of the fight. slice will fight again and that will tell the story better than this fight.  but it just looked too friggin' easy.</body>
