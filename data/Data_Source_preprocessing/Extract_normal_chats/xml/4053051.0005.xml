      <body>  That was my suggesion too. If everyone would grow some nuts and vote for who they like best, as opposed to the lesser of 2 evils, things might change. People are afraid to "waste their vote", which keeps the Democrats/Republicans in power. IMO, a vote for either major party at this point is a wasted vote, at least in the Presidential race. Of course, there isn't much for 3rd chouces either, but at least it sends a message.</body>

      <body>you should vote because it is a right given to you...you either exercise it or you lose it. not voting doesn't change a thing or make any sort of statement or give you more of a right to criticize, no matter what george carlin said, god rest his soul. and voting for a third party or a rebel or a renegade isn't a wasted vote either as most party pollywannacrackers would like you to believe. it's just their way of ensuring that two and only two (arguably one) parties stay in power and to squash that the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and even seven parties that a nation this age and of such diversity should have by now.</body>

      <body>To your question I will just say that the one year that I did not vote Bush won, and in him winning oil prices soared, healthcare, insurance, food prices soared as well. Secondly, It is best that I try to get people in office who will best represent me and the choices I make in life in addition to the lifestyle I choose to keep. I also have a huge fear that if we choose to not be the deciding factors in the candidacy for presidency, then someone else will. Would you feel safe giving that responsibility to any one group in America? Please make your vote count. Consider the most important things in life to you and vote for the person who will most likely help you keep those things close to home. K</body>

      <body> #1. It's called freedom of speech. #2.Ã&#130;Â  If I vote for a candidate and he turns into a huge douchebag do I still have grounds to complain? (e.g. Bush) #3.Ã&#130;Â  If you think every candidate sucks ass and none of them are worthy of your vote you get more respect from me than if you vote for the person that sucks the least [out of the top 2 parties because you think a 3rd party vote is a wasted vote]. #4.Ã&#130;Â  They're taking your money, they're running your lives.Ã&#130;Â  You ALWAYS have the right to complain.</body>
