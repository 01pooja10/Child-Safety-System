 <body>My sources say July 4th our world ends instantly...and a asian nations begins.  I hope we have have someone with a finger on our trigger in a VERY deep bunker July 4th.  Hope they don't get caught with their guard down again this time.  Washington DC may vaporize along with every major city we, our allies, and even possible allies have.  But if there is someone safe in a bunker...with a itchy trigger finger and knowledge on exactly WHO to repay for the free fireworks.  Although perhaps, they may have planned in advance for that possiblity and took the nessesary precautions to defend against such a threat.  It hard to defend yourself, when you KNOW exactly what to expect right?  I truly hope my source is whacked.</body>
