 <body>  I agree. This victim mentality is rampant. The govt. should not have to bail out the citizens who make irresponsible decisions.</body>

 <body>Me too! Its just a big scare tactic by the dems to sell their platform. Notice how they never give you the percentages of those that are in foreclosure? Thats because the last report that came out I think was at 5%!!! So 95% of people are current and paying their mortgages!</body>

 <body>I have one; and yes I was virtually "tricked" into it. The bank held off finallizing it until there wasn't time to protest the arrangements; and since I am always on the road I had to take what they offered. They also put a penalty for early payoff into it.  (I had taken time off to get it all done.) Hopefully I can get it all paid in 3 years, if the idiots in government don't screw things up even worse.</body>

 <body>  Then...apparently you also disagree with McCain's position on the mortgage crisis, which makes this a moot point.</body>

 <body>People making the loans should take a hit in the form of defaults and bankruptcies, aka non-repayments for making bad loans, and not having decent underwriting and actuary work done. People taking the loans should lose their houses, plain and simple.</body>

 <body>  5% on current reports, which is no small number. Plus, you have credit cards up, which suggests some might be financing their mortgages with credit cards, which is going to be another credit bubble. I wouldn't be in huzzah! mode just yet, we are barely out of the first quarter yet, and things could get worse.</body>
