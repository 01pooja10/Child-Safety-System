      <body>A lot of the alien stories were great. It's just when they started showing the smoking man in these meetings a bunch old millionaires that supposedlt controlled the government that it started to annoy me. It got to the point that whenevr that guy showed up, I tuned out. But they made some damn creepy monster episodes that are still great. That is what I am hoping for with this movie.</body>

      <body>I'm *kind of* excited... I remember liking The X-Files up until Mulder stopped appearing on the show... I don't remember the first movie, though. o_O</body>

      <body>I was kind of disapointed when i found out that robert patrick isnt in the new one, he was an important character in the last two seasons, i hope he at least gets some sort of cameo in the movie.</body>

      <body>I'm excited about it! I think they'll do a good enough job to Totally make it worth actually going to a theater. $5 popcorn and everything! Truthfully I'll just sneak in a beer. :)</body>

      <body>  Oh gosh! No shots! Tequila bad for Margo... :)  I did forget 'draft houses' (as we called them in FLA in the '80's) are making a BIG comeback. Yup! That's the way to do it! (Me? No kids, don't drive.)</body>

      <body> I believe it is because the second movie is playing solely off of the first movie, which had Mulder. And everyone want Mulder, anyway. .... Cause he's smexy XD</body>

      <body>I have to admit being an X Files groupie. Maybe because I was not old enough to be interested in it when it was on TV and I have just recently jumped on board within the last 5 years, watching reruns on the Sci Fi channel.</body>
