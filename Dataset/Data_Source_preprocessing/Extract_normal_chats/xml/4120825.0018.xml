 <body>  The person said "Finally,a teenager talking sense" or something along those lines. I hate it when people in their early 20's talk like they were kids 100 years ago.  Tea sippin' bitch? Another English sterotype. How original.  LOL.</body>

 <body>Female superiority thats an oximoron if I ever heard one.We as men are here to do the heavy lifting and you know this man!You need to kill a spider or clean behind the stove you call us.Why are all of these teachers doing their underage students, because when you need dick you take the first dick you see.Women are so pathetic now before you would use a dildo or let your fingers do the walking and now you go after the kid in the Power Ranger t shirt.That statement would be true if you still didn't need us. Female Superiority my foot, now go put that in your pot pipe and smoke it</body>

 <body>  That depends on an individual's idea of "common." It was mainly isolated to cults of the ancient mystery religions(i.e. specifically Greece, Egypt) which had their roots from the mother-son worship started by Semiramis(aka. Astarte, Isis, etc.) upon the death of Cush, father of Nimrod(aka. Osiris, Bacchus, etc.).</body>

 <body>  1) When did I say they weren't a teenager?  2) Don't correct my spelling. It's rude and it's a sign you can't think of anything else to say.  Back to the original topic.</body>
