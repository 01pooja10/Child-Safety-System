      <body>Do you suffer from a persecution/victim complex?  Nobody is "setting Obama up." He has been a media darling for well over a year; since the 2004 Democratic convention, as a matter of fact. It takes a mighty thick tinfoil hat to believe the media is suddenly going to pull the rug out from under him in an effort to give Hillary the nomination.  They might drop the guillotine once the General Election campaign starts, but I honestly doubt they're writing Hillary's obituary as some sort of reverse-psychology to resurrect her campaign with "underdog" votes.  Fact is, Hillary is set to win West Virginia by double-figures and has maintained a 20% + lead in opinion polls there for months, well before any of the post-North Carolina "Hillary is toast" chatter.  She is also heavily favored to win Kentucky and Puerto Rico by double digits, but if she doesn't keep Oregon close the media will continue to declare Hillary dead in the water.</body>

      <body>  Oh, hah, hilarity in its finest. [sarcasm/]  The only time I debate with an Obamabot is if they're totally insane and radicalist, Dunkle, or they're totally wrong, every Obamabot, usually.</body>

      <body>   Hey Bob, what the hell is the Bush/Cheney avatar all about. You DO know that Bush and Cheney are the biggest mass murderers of the 21st century right? Hmmm...I think you should be banned just for having that avatar...but that's just me, and pretty much the rest of the world.</body>

      <body>  A good question to Obama supporters and especially the black voters. Would you support Hillary Clinton if she was chosen to be the nominee by the superdelegates?</body>
