 <body>   I like Superman movies to an extent, until they introduce comic relief. But going off what ERN said. They're real heros (Batman and Iron Man). Real human beings (not aliens from another world) that made themselves, their suits, their weapons, etc. etc. etc. That's pretty cool in a story sense. I found myself feeling like a kid again when I watched Iron Man as Tony Stark built his rocket flying ship (suit). "MAN THAT WOULD BE COOL TO FLY LIKE THAT!" :) is one thought I had :)</body>

 <body>While I don't disagree the pics are nice, being sexy isn't all about looks. It's the attitude of knowing who you are, knowing that you're worth being known, being confident without cockiness. The way you carry yourself. It's about having a sense of humor and being able to laugh at yourself. Taking things in stride as they come....add all those together and the over all package improves tremendously!!</body>

 <body>Superman = sucked worth watching if you are dead bored... Hulk = Worst movie I ever seen Ironman was decent I liked it , perfect actor for the part Batman is alright I still liked Keaton the best. Spiderman has the perfect actor for the part X men decent  Now megan fox as Wonder woman may be decent.</body>

 <body>Ironman is a sweet rendition of the comic book heroe come to life without losing the flair of the character the second one will be totally off the charts : and stan lee is in heaven with the heffner cameo . bat man dark night is head to head they have finally found his best side and between the villans and his gadgets it is wild they were killing him before and it was so close to being like the tv version biff pow zapp crunch lol superman bit the dust dont see a comeback too bad too it was the 1st on the cutting edge too when it first came out</body>
