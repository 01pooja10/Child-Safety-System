 <body>Lawyers are the biggest scumbags to live on this planet, all they care about is there F---ing money They dont care if you go to prison. Why do yuu think most of the people in prison are poor, most of them should be in there but it makes you wonder how many innocent people are there just because the scumbag piece of crap didnt get enuogh money to line his pocket! Then the lump of bile when theyve thoroughly screwed there fellow americans out of everything they have, They somehow think that they are now worthy of representing us as Senetor or Congressman. We dont really even get a choice because chances are both sides of the race are going to be scumbag bile. So thats why we end up with a Congress that has the the worst approvel rating in american history. Most scumbag Lawyers think they are so supperior to the average american that they have no Idea what issues are most important to the people they are supposed to be representing. But they do know how to spend tax money that doesnt belong to them did I mention I hate Lawyers!!!!</body>

 <body> I heard of one "public defender" even showing up DRUNK for a trial! He was do drunk that the judge had to suspend proceedings. Really wonder why these people conduct themselves and treat their indigent clients the way they do.</body>

 <body> You mean a good lawyer, right?  I got my older brother. He's an attorney. Although it would have to deal with real estate. Otherwise, I'm fucked.</body>

 <body> Not yet. But as an educator, I keep my fingers crossed. We're too sue-happy. I love when parents threaten to sue you if you fail their kid who never did homework and always ditches class.</body>

 <body>  In general, ÃÂ I completely disagree. ÃÂ Yes, there are those who are new and doing it for the experience, and there are those who are doing it because they have to and really donÃ¢â¬â¢t care because they are getting far less for representing someone under the Public Defenders arrangement that they would from a paying customer.ÃÂ  But there are also those who are doing it because they have a desire to see that everyone is defended. ÃÂ  I was on a murder jury where the defendant was defended by the Public Defenders office.ÃÂ  These guys threw their hearts and souls into the defense.ÃÂ  Too bad the guy was guilty as hell, but they mounted several appeals after the conviction, interviewed every member of the jury that would talk to them, and I understand that they are still trying to get this dude out.ÃÂ  I contrast that to a lawyer I had, gave him a large retainer, and he withdrew from the case after he had spent it all, much more, and I asked him to put me on a payment plan.</body>
