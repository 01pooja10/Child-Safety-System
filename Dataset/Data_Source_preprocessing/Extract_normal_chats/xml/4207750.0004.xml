 <body>I was driving to work in West Austin (the pricey part of town) on Thursday, and I saw a white, TapOut-clad teenaged kid driving a new Escalade on rims with 'Team Hughes' stickers all over the back while basing Tupac.  It was quite possibly the proudest moment of my life. I had witnessed the pinnacle of our civilization.</body>

 <body>im not afraid to admit that I was a fan of slice. i said as soon as Shamrock weighed in at 206.5 that a lighter fighter would be the most dangerous scenario for an inexperienced gorilla like Kimbo. I never had any illusions about him. I thought that at best, he'd have a 10-4 or 12-6 record at 38. Slice has never even had an amateur career and he's going up against guys who've been doing it their entire lives. he was SUPPOSED to be fighting tomato cans. everybody demanded that he fight stiffer competition to justify the personna that Elite XC manufactured or magnified for him. i wasn't a supporter because I bought into that hype. the fight world and entertainment in general has always been plagued by that kind of hypocrisy. good fiction outsells reality in every genre.</body>

 <body>  cant argue with you about that, and to be honest after listening to him talk after the fight, and listening to his interview I think i have more respect for the guy, although i still didnt like the fact that he wouldnt touch gloves. More than anything what i've always disliked about kimbo is his gangster attitude and crew and persona. But again after last night, his humility surprised me. What surprised me even more was the absence of his don king like promoter. perhaps he dropped him, which id respect yet again</body>

 <body>  yeah, it was a good story while it lasted and it was telling that it was a former ufc guy that nailed him in a matter of seconds. this may signal the end of XC.  but his story is not over yet because of the ad hoc nature of the fight. slice will fight again and that will tell the story better than this fight.  but it just looked too friggin' easy.</body>

 <body>Kimbo Slice is a ragged gangster. He has no class, and no respect. His first fight, his interview, he had a little front put .. he won 3 straight fights.. the guy turned into a cocky street piece of shit again. This guy is far from professional, and I believe Ken Shamrock could've destroyed the guy in every aspect of MMA.</body>
