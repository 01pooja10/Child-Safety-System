 <body>The truth is nothing is suppose to be in the breifcase. It's up to the viewer what is it in the case. Tarantino and Avary didn't know what to put in the case since they thought the diamonds from the heist in Reservoir Dogs wasn't original enough.    Also what religious text does it say the Devil takes the soul from the back of the neck? Rhames just had a scar on the back of his neck, and Tarantino being the perfectionist he is, didn't want the scar on screen. Hense the band-aid, and this is backed up by Tarantino himself.    The rest are just theories.</body>

 <body>For a long time I thought it was a gateway to hell, or something along those lines. But that was mostly due to the fact that the combination to the briefcase appeared to be "666" and when opened, it glowed orange/yellow/gold colors, resembling the colors of fire. That's wrong though I'm sure. I like the theory of Marcellus' soul</body>

 <body>The reason why he did that was a trick on the audience. It's a way of pulling you in.  It's the same with Kill Bill when Beatrix's name is bleeped out.</body>

 <body>  Pastors do the same thing in church. They'll be right in the middle of a statement and then say "HELLO", or something like it.  It's a way to keep us ADD people paying attention. lol</body>
