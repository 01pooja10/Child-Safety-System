 <body>I love The Shining. Kubrick's vision is fantastic. A real atmospheric chiller, with a very chilling score too.</body>

 <body>I think that reading the book first spoils the movie, but the shining on its own is a brilliant movie, only Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson could do it ;)</body>

 <body>I love the Shining, although lets all be honest its getting kinda dated. The campy 70s interior of the Overlook is killing the wicked storyline. I think if you can overlook the camp factor the movie is a true classic. I'd love to see it redone, but cant think of anyone better than Jack...  We may be the last generation to truly love this movie in all its campy classic-ness...  How sad.</body>

 <body>first off. you cant compare books and movies. there two different mediums. of course the movie is going to leave stuff out. you really just cant comapare them.    two: the movie is technically based off the book, but lets be honest, half of the story was completely changed. its almost a whole other story.    i get so tired of all these elitest book worms thinking there art is so much better them film.</body>

 <body>The shinning is a classic hands down! I wasn't really scared of the movies until I saw two scenes.    1. The hot naked chick turning into a old ugly woman.    2. A guy in the bear suite giving oral to some random dude.      The whole bear thing scared the shit out of me for a week!</body>

 <body>The Shining is good, but I got Dr Strangelove the other day and it's just brilliant in almost every way.</body>

 <body>Well about two or three years ago, i had to write a review for this film and obviously had to analyze the film. I enjoyed it quite alot and have watched it again for pure entertainment. A good film overall.</body>
