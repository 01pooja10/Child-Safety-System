 <body>  Thankyou, excellent rebuttal. So would you say it's a mistake for these conservative radio show heads to continually refer to Reagan as the Great One?  It's almost as if they worship him like a god. That has to be a huge turn off to black voters.</body>

 <body>  the legend is always greater than the facts.ÃÂ  guys like rush aren't looking at facts anyway; they're looking for spins for their personal agenda.ÃÂ  funny how they don't remember that about 1/2 of his second term he was in the first phase of alzeimers (which does explain a lot!)</body>
