 <body>That's very Machiavelian. Can't have another prince's army running amok in your territory.</body>

 <body>  It's purely Machiavelian...during a cease-fire no less. It's a play out of the Prince playbook.</body>

 <body>  No. That's going too far. Expel them from Iraq, let someone else deal with them. All we have to do is get a secure Iraq for now. I think I under estimated the Iraqi government's... ruthless efficiency.</body>

 <body> I bet within the next 4 months we'll have almost no Mahdi Army left and Sadr will be captured/killed or "studying and praying", no politics. Remember, a few weeks ago he issued one statement saying that he wants "to drop out of politics", I think it won't take much time for us to see another similar declaration issued by him.. I just hope our guys will keep doing what they are doing now!..</body>

 <body>I think he is reaching for an epiphany of non-violent protest. I wish him God's speed on that epiphany before the fighting gets worse.</body>

 <body> Maybe you are right, I think they won't get a warm welcome in Iran if they fail to keep Basra. The ISF need to seal the border completely and we are needed there to help them..</body>

 <body> It's possible, but I think it's more likely he fears losing his power in an all-out war with the ISF. He feels he could be defeated, so he's playing the non-violence card in a desperate attempt to maintain control.</body>
