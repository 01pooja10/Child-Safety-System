 <body>  I see.  I stand corrected.  Now that little mystery is solved, let's get onto the second: "Why was such a term used in this thread in response to my post?"</body>

 <body>I'm probably going to get flamed for this........    Scotland benefits more from Public Spending then the South East. We may benefit from Scottish oil but they benefit from our taxes.</body>

 <body>  It does point out that England isn't the only one to benefit from the Union. The South East might be the wealthiest part of the country, however it also pays most tax per head and spends less per head in public spending.</body>

 <body>   i agree,  as for scottish oil, i doubt that they will be able to nationalise the oil, currently the profits get sent in londons direction but there is a lot of scottish financial interest down here so what is being proposed would essentially receive opposition from scottish business who would be loosing out to scottish politics  nevertheless, i believe the main problem is thatÂ the oil may be up there, but we own the technology to properly extract it  southerners get taxed to the hilt in proportion to what we get for our taxes,  whats happening with the credit crunch now is interesting  big business is coming under scrutony because of its corruption, but what the silent majority dont realise is that greedy london business is the only thing keeping this country going at the moment, if the banks flop then we can fall back on our steel works or engineering, we have a global economy and apart from business, britain has nothing of great significance to offer  its said that we are now a service economy but i think that is just a political buzz term for fucc all, in an age of mass outsourcing of our services, i think its a bit of orwellian double think</body>

 <body>  It's quite amazing how rude some people can be.  My first post said "Discuss" with the title asking a question, not making a statement. If I made a blatant statement then that would warrant your abuse, which is quite easy to dish out considering you've got a computer to hide behind.  I would carry this on but knowing how people behave online you'll most probably either...  1) Make some trashy comment based on insults that can't be backed up.  2) Start twisting my words round so it makes out I've meant something else.  3) Just play dumb and pretend you don't understand what I said even though you did. All because you can't think of a response that doesn't feature the 3 usual responses I've listed here.  It's all predictable.  LOL.</body>

 <body>Or maybe the 4th option which is to change the subject entirely.  Interesting you mention it though. Yep, until now I did know LOL but not GTFO. But then again I know the Spanish for "Hello", but without knowing the whole Spanish language.</body>
