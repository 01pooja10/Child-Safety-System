 <body>  And did you have a comment to go with this one Maxwell? By the way, i'm still eagerly anticipating your response to my reply about those "perversions" you were talking about in that other thread when you get a moment.  P.S. You wouldn't happen to be one of those evangelicals would you? Your posts always seem to have a similar air about them as an evangelical on a moral crusade.</body>

 <body> Anything wrong with being evangelical in belief? The "gay lifestyle" is not for everyone!!</body>

 <body>  I asked a question if you had any comment about this article, along with a brief nudge to point you to that other thread where you were speaking of gays as "abnormal" and "perverted".  Obviously you have no real comment to make on this topic, or do you? Did you want to talk about the evils of drinking perhaps? Or maybe you wanted to say how evil technology is? Who knows, perhaps you can enlighten us with your gospel?</body>

 <body> Thank God these two "drunken wenches" were stopped from opening the plane door at 30,000 feet! Passengers who fly should watch their intake of alcohol and other spirits. Man, what was going through their "alcohol soaked" minds?"</body>

 <body>  Another question, and perhaps quite an important one is what was going through the minds of those who allowed these on the plane? Usually there's a sign at the check in saying that they have the right to refuse passage to anyone appearing drunk, etc.. But you're always going to get things like this happening.  And what we don't know either is how much the cabin crew took from them for any in flight drinks? I know that they're not usually too fussy when it comes to selling drinks on flights, they probably make a bit of commission off them, so safety is a secondary issue.</body>

 <body>When these two "lushes" started to "act up" why weren't they cut off? Any other drinking establishment would have done that!</body>

 <body>  Who knows. Like I said, you're not going to stop these kinds of things. I do think there are more important things in the world to worry about though than incidents like this.</body>

 <body>A bunch of "out of control "wenches", a sudden decompression" of an aircraft. That not important?</body>

 <body>  Maxwell, I said there are MORE IMPORTANT things in the world to worry about.  By the way, still no response on that other thread, what happened?  Stuck for words?</body>

 <body> Should airlines permanently suspend the sale of alcohol aboard domestic and international flights after this "near incident" with two "drunken wenches" who wanted "fresh air" at 30,000 feet?</body>
