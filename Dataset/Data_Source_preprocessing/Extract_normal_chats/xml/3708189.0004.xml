 <body>infact who apart from old and disabledÂ people get free transport?  i never had free transport ever,   infact this last week has cost me about 140 quid because of a broken oyster machine and its knock on effects  theres me sluggin my guts out and ppl get free transport?   im gettin sick ofÂ TFL, they treat you like cattle and mug youÂ off when something goes wrong and it neverÂ endsÂ    infact that settles it, im not voting for ken purely because of TFL, they disgust me as a company, and the worst thing is I am dependant on them....Â I give them money everyday</body>

 <body>    lol  the first point is quite an outlandish claim to make, boris has only mentioned london in the house of commons once, are you sure?????   i agree the fact he is from london and always lived hereÂ is a good point, but it doesnt mean he hasnt been filling his boots at our expense in the meantime like the rest of them, ken brought in bob from new york to sort out the tube, the guy was a raging alcoholic who had a breakdown, did an interview in the standard saying he hasnt done anything and is still gettin paid   </body>

 <body>     you cant credit ken for the london olympics, east london is as prime a location for an olympics, all that waste land in east london needed something doing with it, ken was in the right place at the right time and jumped on the bandwagon,  seb coe ran the bid to the olympic commitee, big business sponsored it, david beckham swung the vote  ANY mayor would have said yes to the olympics considering the prestige atatched to it,   personally i think the olympics will be a big waste of money that wont actually help the people who live in east london much, just price them out of their own areas  i also disagree with you on the transport for london, yes the tories ballsed up on things a while ago, but a lot of time has passed since then, a lot of money has been spent on the underground since ken got in power and the only difference in service has been the price of ticket as far as i can see and i use it every day,  there was the fiasco of bob kielly or whatever he's called, the dude who ran new yorks subway, he did an interview with the evening standard where he confessed he was an alcoholic and a waste of our money, but ken stuck with him, that guy is on a whopping big contract, between 1-400k a year, i dont remember exactly, google it, but he got paid like a prince to get fucking pissed everyday    what kids get free transport? i never had free transport EVER when i was growing up, screw these free transport kids, they need to learn the value of money at some point otherwise your just breeding the next welfare generation</body>
