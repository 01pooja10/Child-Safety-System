 <body>it's definately dedicated to his ex and i'm sure he did posted.it's obvious that he's not ready for a new gf yet,so give him that time cuz all he needs right now is a good friend until he's ready to open his heart to someone else again.  i hope i answered your question...</body>

 <body>  i think every one desrves a chance. but if you think he still has feelings for tihs other girl than it wont work out. trust me. i know i speak jibberish most of the time lol. but ive been through alot and i have been through that whole thing before. if your getting stessed over if he still has feelings for this girl it will make it harder on your relationship. you said you guys have been together for 2 years on and off. but thats not really that long. your still young and can find plentry of others, who you CAN trust and know for a fact that your the only one they care about. i hope this helps and makes sense lol.</body>
