 <body>   That just sounds like one big bureaucracy to me. While foreign countries are profiting from the US bases; the National Debt goes up even further.  Do we really need that many bases overseas?</body>

 <body>   My information is based on my education as well as my experience. I have been personally involved in the above examples in some form or another, be it working with S-3/G-3 or dealing with the local bureaucracy.  As I stated, take some international economics classes and take a look at teh details of the Defense Budget.</body>

 <body>  We don't, no, not after the break-up of the Soviet Union, but those bases are such an integral part of the world economy at this point we wouldn't be able to shut them all down without causing serious amounts of economic damage.</body>

 <body>Believe me, guys, I'm very much a "take care of our own first" kinda guy. I firmly believe we should withdraw all forces from overseas, peaceful or otherwise. I don't see the need for 14 active Aircraft Carriers plus escorts, either. I also hate the fact that so much of our own economy is tied up in the world market, as well as the fact that we pay out billions in foreign aid when we've got people starving in the streets.  I'm a staunch isolationist; always have been.  However, what I like and don't like doesn't change the facts. I'm willing to make the sacrifices necessary to withdraw into our shells and take care of ourselves first, but I can't make that choice for the rest of the country (which is why I will never run for office). What's good for me isn't always good for everyone else.</body>

 <body>   Next-Gen Nuke Subs and F-22s I'm okay with, although not nearly in the number we are building. We need to stay on top as far as conventional military technology is concerned, and I'm okay with a few wings of $130+ billion aircraft.</body>

 <body>   The part about 700 bases in 130 countries is true, the rest is opinion.</body>

 <body>  The Constitution doesn't give any president the power to rule the world.Â  That's true as well.Â  As for his opinions, a lot of them are favorable on the world stage.</body>

 <body>Yes, despite all the aid the US gives out, which - by the way - is done on purpose as a bureacratic tool to get them to rely on us, they don't like us - and they want us out.  Popular world vote does NOT like the US policing the world, and despite how they act when we give them aid etc, it makes them rely on us, and in reality makes them despise us more. It's all about the pecking order, and the side effects of reliance - as opposed to independents. This also gets "misconstrued" as a forced feeling of inferiority, which is also unliked.  This is the general world opinion of the US.  Lets get the hell out, it will benefit everyone involved in the long run.</body>

 <body>   Tell that to the United Nations. A HUGE majority of the relief and peacekeeping missions we are on, worldwide, are the result of UN mandate.  Do some research instead of spewing Ron Paul blogs.</body>
