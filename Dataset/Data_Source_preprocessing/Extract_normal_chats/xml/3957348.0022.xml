      <body>   whoops, responded to the wrong post. anyway, I'm curious to see what stone will do with the material recent history has presented him, and hopefully will stir intelligent debate, rather than the shouting and name calling that is passed off as political discourse on FUX and CNN.</body>

      <body> Ah, so i bet you believe that Roosevelt had absolutely NO idea about Pearl harbor huh?  not saying Bush did or didn't have anything to do with his daddy's enemy for whom till this day we have no caught nor went after...  Also did we ever find the WMDs? you know the ones that were in the country that had Nothing to do with 9/11?  point is, You DON'T know he didn't just as we don't know he did, cause you are not in the office to know what goes on in the lying politicians doors..  THEY ALL LIE, so how do you even know what to believe?  he has his right to say Bush may have planned it, but in term you call him a name for his opinion, thats very American, no wonder why other countries hate us, hell we can't even like nor respect each other...unless we are being blown up</body>

      <body>i see this thread becoming locked just as the Anti-Christian..  2 things that should never be discussed on non related boards to the topics..  Religion and Politics.. they are the same thing and lead to the same end result...</body>

      <body> And it's very black of you to get up on your soapbox and talk about America.  Wanna keep going? 'Cause I will.</body>

      <body>  As for the movie... I'm not really interested in seeing it. Stone hasn't made a film that's interested me since U-Turn. Yeah, that was hardly cinematic greatness but it was interesting.</body>
