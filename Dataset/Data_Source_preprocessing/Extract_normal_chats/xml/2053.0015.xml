      <body>Having cocktails at the nugget &amp; the dorms are pretty fun. well they are until the boys roll up with you with their christmas lights and handcuff you for enjoying a forsty cold beverage outside the dorms. weenies. i don't believe i'm much of a fan of the campus police dept.</body>

      <body>I just transferred here from OCC in Fall 2004. I think the people and the professors are really great. But what do you guys mean by "put yourself out there"? I'm a commuter and I work so I find it hard to meet ppl. (I just go to class then leave cause I have to get to work). I just bought a condo so I can't exactly move to LB. Also, I find it really hard to meet ppl my age: everyone's either young or old. I want to make some friends so HELP! Send me a message if you can/want.    Thanks guys</body>

      <body>A friend of mine goes there and he really likes it. He was a screw up in High School and he went to com. college for a couple of years and now he is really achieving serious potential. I think that it might be good for some people and not for others...    raissa</body>

      <body>i just moved here to long beach from the second largest campus in the country (the ohio state university) granted csulb is no big ten school it's easy as fuck to make friends here... any school you go to you will have people complaining that its like high school if you know tons of people that go to high school there.... 30% of my high school in ohio went to ohio state many of whom were my friends.... but when i left all my everyday friends were people i met in bars and at parties or on campus in classes or study groups... stop bitching about it being like high school.... maybe next time you walk to class instead of talking on your cell phone to your loser high school friends you should be signing up for organizations and social clubs... theyre there for a reason</body>
