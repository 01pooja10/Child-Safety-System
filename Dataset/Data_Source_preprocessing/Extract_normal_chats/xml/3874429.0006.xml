 <body>It's a pretty simple prescription, really. Cut taxes, cut spending, and STOP INFLATING!  That should fly with politicians and the public about as well as recommendations for diet and exercise to improve their health. Why go to all that pain and effort, when there just HAS to be a magic pill that can fix it all?</body>

 <body>Who said anything about being an isolationist? Its about being a non-interventionist and mind your own business but still trade and travel. Do you call other countries isolationist because they dont police the world?</body>

 <body>  Our troops being stationed in other countries such as Germany and Japan have more to do with international economical matters than anything else. Withdrawing our forces from peaceful overseas assignments will cripple several national economies worldwide and cause an international economic crisis.</body>

 <body>   Take a world economics class, then delve into the finer points of the Defense Budget. For example, the U.S. doesn't own any of the land in the countries it has forces stationed (peacefully or otherwise). The land is rented. In Germany money is paid to the German Government every time a military vehicle is driving off of the installation. The German Government is paid a fee every time a hole is dug on the military installation itself, too. Same thing with the use of the rifle range. Let's not even get into the millions of dollars spent every year by the troops themselves within the country (the alcohol purchase alone would fund a couple of social programs here in the U.S.).  When we first set up the airbase in Hungary in support of the Operation Joint Endeavor in 1995 we almost tripled two-thirds of the country's Gross National Product.  South Korea actually only pays about 20% of their defense budget; we handle the rest in accordance of their treaty. If we were to just up and leave, they'd have to make up that last 80% in the face of North Korea's "million man army."  Need more examples?</body>
