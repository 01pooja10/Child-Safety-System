 <body>The problem with Transformers:  It's a movie about a toy. Michael Bay directed it. Jerry Bruckheimer produced it. Shia Laboeuf was in it.</body>

 <body>   Exactly, look at all the CRAPPY movies made from DC characters. I'm hating this JLA movie already and it's not even out yet.</body>

 <body>   and that's EXACTLY what ruined all the past Transformer franchieses. Too much focus on humans, especially annoying little kids.  In Generation 1 the balance was perfect. A lot of fans my age say that the saturation of too many new Transformers ruined Generation 1 and made it get cancelled. I don't think so. I think it was the saturation of Daniel being used too much, too many times when the parents were the focus of attention, then they did what Star Trek and Return Of The Jedi made mistakes with, they brought in too many different alien species, which has the same effect as too many humans. The attention was taken away from the Transformers.</body>

 <body>   Well Mr. Allen, I can't really disagree with you. I'm a TF Fanboy myself. I think I feel a bit of excitement, but that could be anxiety and worry over how bad it might be ruined even more. Instead of a magical cube that they all sprouted up from, they might create some other magical ooze that the cube sprang from without any answers to any questions.</body>
