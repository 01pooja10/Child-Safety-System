 <body>Just finished watching it. Ok, I was wrong, Last House on the Left does not feature the most vile rape scene ever put on film. Whoa. But hey, at least the victim is not stabbed to death then disemboweled or forced to pee on herself. The I Spit rapists are real humanitarians. The movie itself was not as bad as I remembered it. In fact, while I guess it's really impossible to say you liked or enjoyed a film like this, I must say this is a decent film. The acting was good, and the story was ok. The DVD edition I rented cleaned up the picture beautifully. There's no way I saw a version as pristine as this when I saw it at the drive-in or on vhs 20+ years ago. All the dvd extras were great. Original reviews were available including two I remember very well, from Siskel(RIP) and my man Ebert, that caused it to be removed from the old United Theater here in Chicago. The director of the film gives an interesting commentary and tells about an actual event in his own life that he says inspired him to tell the story. I'd actually have to go against the guys and give this film a marginal thumbs up. The dvd as a package is very good and kudos to the director for not doing a musical score.</body>

 <body>One of the best shocker film IMO  This film is disturbingly spectacular and one of the best revenge film ever.  Kill Bill eat your heart out :)   Was it the uncut version why they shove the broken bottle in her erm erm you know what during the rape scene? Ouch that scene was gruesome....This film is technically a lesson to men...  Lesson being Don't fuck with a woman otherwise, she'll cut your balls off in the bath :)</body>

 <body>  The film is brilliant, i watch it on horror channel, i'm still waiting to get it and find it cheap on DVD, 15 pound is way too much. But trust me this film will make you look at women in a different light lol.   Another few great recommendations for horror from the 1980s  The Burning Silent Night, Deadly Night  I'm Downloading them currently</body>
