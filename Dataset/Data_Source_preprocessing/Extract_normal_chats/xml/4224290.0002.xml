 <body>  So you will be eating the freedom fries? No, continental europe is not having any wars with europe, nor is UK, maybe just crazy UK expat mercenaries. But the limeys were always pirates. Considering that the US military has spent the last 60 years fighting 3rd world militaries, it would be interesting to see what happens when they invade Russia. I wouldn't, but I have been raised with stories from where we did it last time.</body>

 <body>  A VERY flimpsy retort. The "I've got black friends" statement, or "I shagged a black" excuse also doesn't carry water these days :)</body>

 <body>  Have you married a London woman? As well as is there such thing as a Anglophobe or is it knowledge and caution? No Austrian girl ever hit me in the head with a bottle...</body>
