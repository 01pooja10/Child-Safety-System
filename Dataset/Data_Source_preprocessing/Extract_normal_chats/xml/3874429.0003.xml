 <body>The first thing I do, when I'm low on cash?  Stop spending.  The second?  Raise my income (find a new job, or for the government, raise revenue).  I think this is a good general order.</body>

 <body>It's a pretty simple prescription, really. Cut taxes, cut spending, and STOP INFLATING!  That should fly with politicians and the public about as well as recommendations for diet and exercise to improve their health. Why go to all that pain and effort, when there just HAS to be a magic pill that can fix it all?</body>

 <body>Who said anything about being an isolationist? Its about being a non-interventionist and mind your own business but still trade and travel. Do you call other countries isolationist because they dont police the world?</body>

 <body>  Our troops being stationed in other countries such as Germany and Japan have more to do with international economical matters than anything else. Withdrawing our forces from peaceful overseas assignments will cripple several national economies worldwide and cause an international economic crisis.</body>
