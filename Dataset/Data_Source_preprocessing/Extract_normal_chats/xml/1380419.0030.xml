 <body>Alex: There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar trying to make up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening. The Korova milkbar sold milk-plus, milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom, which is what we were drinking. This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.    I wish we had a Korova Milkbar here ... with Pat Roach as a bouncer.    Alex: Excuse me, Mrs. Can you please help? There's been a terrible accident! My friend's in the middle of the road bleeding to death! Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?</body>

 <body>What part are you going for? Alex, I hope :)    It's really hard to find other books like ACwO... The kinds of things that come up as 'similar' to it are Catch-22, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, Slaughterhouse-5... You could do something from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but I really wouldn't know which part. Or something from The Wasp Factory?    There are some fair monologues in American Psycho, although I guess Bateman isn't close enough to an 'Alex' to convince your teachers you could play the part...      Bravo to your school though; edgy play to attempt!!</body>

 <body>Sorry, didn't notice: you're a girl! :P Doesn't mean you can't play Alex... he IS meant to be 15, so maybe 18 y/o boys will be too mature ;)    If you're not going for that part, may I ask what are you going for?</body>

 <body>You can absolutely be Alex as a girl...I dressed as him for halloween two years in a row...I had to improvise with the costume though...you'ld be amazed at how much attention a girl in a jock strap over white quilted long johns get...I was amazed however at how small the population of people that know this movie is. Everyone I know has seen it, but people would ask what are you, I'd tell them and get this blank stare...felt like beating the crap out of them with my walking stick!!!    Welly Welly.</body>
