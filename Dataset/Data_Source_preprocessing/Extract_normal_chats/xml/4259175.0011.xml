 <body>  That's funny...lol "black leprechaun"..But trust me, there are some out there. Just ask Fox News. And besides, one of the local news channels was able to find one when they went to the local Republican Party watch Party last night. They asked this one black guy who claimed to be Republican how he felt and he said that he was sad but that "it is what it is..." I wish I could find him and ask him how he really feels...</body>

 <body>I'll try to answer the question the way my good friend who is a black republican that voted for mccain answered.  In her own words, the discomfort of having an unqualified President far outweighs the cultural achievment of America having elected the first black President. She also said the fact that American's are making such a huge deal about his race only makes her less impressed with the accomplishment.  She said when we have a black President that isn't constantly refered to as the First Black President then they will be more pride in the accomplishment.</body>

 <body>  When McCain 2008 turned out to be a shadow of McCain 2004 AND his pick Sarah Palin. Some of Obama's policy ideas appeal to me and the way he ran his campaign showed REAL LEADERSHIP</body>

 <body>  Her argument is very bogus. How can one not make a big deal about him being the first black president. She is only saying this because he is not republican or conservative. If it had been Colin Powell (who was being heavily recruited) would she be more impressed? But the media would still make a big deal of his race, because it is historic, regardless of what Party the person comes from....I always laugh when people say they want us to live in a color-blind society: the fact is that people do see color, the question is can you be mature enough to not let it cloud your judgment? The fact that race did not play a huge fact in this election is testament to how far we have come....</body>

 <body>  Interesting. I think Palin hurt McCain a little bit and it was sad to see McCain pander to the base of his party, but I think more than anything else it was the failures of George W. Bush that got Obama elected..</body>

 <body>   I seriously doubt Barack X will do anything "GREAT".  His election will only be "HISTORIC" cause hes black.  and this thread proves it.</body>

 <body>   This was a conversation we had about a month ago, and I haven't talked to her since the results were official, but I would image her opinion is still the same.  We were in a mall and this guy stopped us (i was her and a white guy that had an obama shirt on) and he asked us what basically the same question you did, and that's how you answered.  I didn't want to debate her in the mall so I didn't say anything, but I think there obviously is a cultural significance, but I don't know if its a Jackie Robinson type of accomplishment. His accomplishment was ending the ban on black players. Obama isn't breaking down a legal barrier, but it is a social barrier.  IDK, I'm more looking forward to the change he'll bring than his color though.</body>

 <body>  Why did you stop with Barack X? You forgot the Barack Hussein Obama. I cannot get over thehuge irony that here we are in a war with Islamo-fascists and we elect a president named Barack Hussein Obama. hahahahaha. I love it...</body>
