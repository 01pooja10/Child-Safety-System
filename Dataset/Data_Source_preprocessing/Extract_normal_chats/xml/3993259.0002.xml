 <body>I'm just glad that the Democrates actaully have a nominee now. And I'm glad it's Obama. Now the next thing that needs to happen is for him to become President. We don't need McCain. He is the biggest joke ever.</body>

 <body>  The American people chose Obama. And don't come here giving me that "Hillary had the popular vote" bullshit. The only reason she had slightly more popular votes then Obama was because his name wasn't on the ballot in Michigan when hers was. lol@Clinton and her dumb supporters wanting those votes to count.</body>

 <body>Actually, It was Obama who pulled his name from the Michigan ballot, so that's his problem for not getting the count in that state. Michigan just did what he asked. Its his fault for pulling his name.  This is why election reform needs to be done. do what the republicans do, just get the votes and be done with it. none of this "delegates" and "super delegates" bull.</body>

 <body>Also to add, if Clinton does vie for the VP position, then that will be a better choice for the Democrats; Obama needs to stop being a pussy when it comes to illegal immigration.</body>

 <body>It's time for a change. Plus it's not like Obama is going to be a bad President, I would have been fine with Clinton. It's McCain we have to worry about. If he become President we are in a world of shit. Obama is going to be a great President. Time will prove that.</body>

 <body>   There was no point to leave the names on the ballots since the states were stripped of all its delegates to the national convention for breaking party rules by moving its primary to before February 5. All candidates abided by an agreement not to campaign in Florida, and all major candidates except for Hillary Clinton had removed their names from the Michigan ballot.</body>
