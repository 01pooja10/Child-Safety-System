 <body>The Brazilian Job: the follow up to Paramountâs US remake of The Italian Job is still on the cards, and itâs got a 2009 release date marked. Jason Statham, Mos Def, Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are attached, as is director F Gary Gray.  I, Robot 2: All we know on this one is that itâs in the scripting stages still, with a potential 2010 release date planned in. No news on Mr Smith's involvement.  I Am Legend 2: Warnerâs huge Christmas 2007 hit could also have a follow up, although itâd be interesting to see if Will Smith returned to it. A 2010 release date is also being mooted for this one.  Rest of the list is located below.   www.icanspeel.com</body>

 <body>  Shrek 4 was announced ages ago but animated movies usually take a couple of years to make so I think it comes out next year. The films have been that successful that they don't need to wait to see if the latest film does well before announcing another sequel.  Judging by the amount of sequels planned it seems that Hollywood is playing it safe.</body>

 <body>This is going to be very interesting!!  Silent Hill in my opinion was all I expected in a movie.. i have never played the games, but knew alot about the story...wonder where they are going to take this sequel!  Ace Ventura 3: oh please no!!!  The People Under The Stairs 2: wonder what made them after all these years to finally make a part 2.  The Untouchables: looking forward to this one!  Thought I heard a couple of years ago about Ghostship 2 being in post production? guess i heard wrong!</body>
