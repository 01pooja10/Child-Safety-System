      <body>  No they will be a load of Hyped Bullocks Garbage  Child's Play could work but what else can they do with it make it more scarier nada, just probably add more gore and CGI  Dragon Ball, do i hear a fan riot for making a white guy, Goku  Friday the 13th being produced by Michael Bay, juss gonna have more gore and under developed character background on Jason Voorhees as for Bay has poor developmental writing skills. Which will also be his flaw when he comes to produced and co-write 'A Nightmare On Elm St (2010).  Tekken automatically fails</body>

      <body>  That's exactly it.  I'm actually kind of curious on Dave's comment.  Remakes equal easy money. Then again, the originals stand to earn money too. Remake comes out, then it makes people want to see the original. According to my list, 2009 stands to be a much bigger year than 2008. Incredible Hulk can suck a fat one. Even though it looks better than the last one, still looks like shit.</body>

      <body>They make crappy movies because you pay to see them. People payed money to see Meet the Spartans, Date movie, Epic Movie, etc... but nobody paid to see There Will Be Blood... so... which movies will the studio continue to produce?</body>

      <body>Define new?  2007 was one of the strongest years in recent memory.  2008 is off to a weak start.  Both of those have something to do with the writers strike, I think.  And yes, expand the horizons and stop watching what Hollywood wants you to watch. Also, while you're at it, turn off your FM radios and delete your MTVs. You'll thank me later.  Garbage does rock though...</body>

      <body> No, it's just because we the movie goers don't care to see originals therefore they don't get released everywhere, nor during the summer..  Box office shows that we prefer popcorn movies over movies that are really good like say, No Country for Old men, There will be blood, those movie didn't do a fraction of what that mess called Spider-man 3 did..  And like i said, we will just see how many of you that keep screaming for something original in hollywood, that will head out to watch The Strangers May 30th.. in fact how many of you have even bothered to rent The Orphanage?</body>
