 <body>A 70-year-old Israeli woman in the southern village of Yesha has been killed by a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, Israeli officials have said.  The rocket scored a direct hit on her house in the small farming community.  She is the second Israeli civilian to be killed by rocket or mortar fire from Gaza in less than a week.  The latest death comes as Egypt is trying to mediate a truce between Israel and Hamas, the militant Palestinian group which controls Gaza.  The head of Egyptian intelligence, Omar Suleiman, has been in Israel for talks with political leaders.  Last month the plans were given the backing of a dozen Palestinian factions including, Hamas - which has controlled Gaza since last year - and the Fatah movement of President Mahmoud Abbas.  Israel said any truce agreement must include the release of a captured Israeli soldier and an end to arms smuggling into Gaza.  The Israeli military launches frequent air strikes or incursions into Gaza in an attempt to stop the frequent rocket fire from the territory into southern Israel.  Mortar fire from Gaza killed an Israeli man on Friday in the kibbutz of Kfar Aza. Three people were wounded.  Israeli air strikes then killed five members of Hamas.  The Gaza Strip has been controlled by Hamas since last June when they ousted their rivals from the Fatah movement.   Story from BBC NEWS:</body>

 <body>  McCain? You think McCain will win? I hope your wrong. I don't want to spend another 100 years in Iraq, nor do I support sombody who is buddy buddy with the lazy bum of a president we have.  To some Iraqis, we may be terrorists. But to us Americans, we are not terrorists. Its just how you view it. I don't agree with Iraq, I support pulling out, and taking care of our problems here. Besides, although our government is pretty much lazy and getting paid for doing nada, that does not mean that the rest of the country does not care. We do alot for the world, and we try to act out of morals and good hearts. I'm serious. We give aid to countries in need, we try to have a equal and fair country, we support values and good will, and we are very optimistic people. We try to be a good force in the world, even though it may not seem like it to you. I'm proud of this country and what it has done for the world, even though it has made some stupid mistakes. Such as this war. But, with all good comes the bad, and the in between. Nothing is perfect in life.</body>

 <body>  And I'm sure al-Sadr loves to bathe in the blood of the slain!  Seriously, it would be in everyone's best interest if the Iraqis were just left to their own devices.</body>

 <body>  Yes to some Iraqis, we may be terrorists and to some Iraqis we may not be. Who are you to decide that all Iraqis don't want us there? There must be some who are glad we got rid of Sadam . *This is not my personal oppinion, just common sense*  And you really don't need to swear. You keep on blabbing how you report people for saying the word "idiot" when you clearly say the F word. Twice. So I guess I should just report you for your dirty language. Hmm??  Nobody asked you to give a "s..." about us Americans. We don't need your "give a s." We have eachother, our pride, stability, and optimism. Who cares what in the world you think?  All our current government cares for is oil. All our future government will care about is God willing, Americans.  And also, those places are "s" holes to you, you probley have not visited them, thus you have no basis to call them "s" holes because you have no grounds to do so.  Andddd our country is not "f" up. Thats just what you think. And I'm sure most people could care less about wht you think when all you think is dirty words.</body>

 <body>Alright, I won't quote you anymore.  It doesn't seem like you have anything better to say other than insults anyway.</body>
