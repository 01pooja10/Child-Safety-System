 <body>no problem, I'll give you two Carbon Copy and Virtuosity.    I am not even going to get into his newer stuff because he is just an angry black man. Like I said, as much range as Bruce Willis, no matter what he does, its Bruce Willis. No matter what Denzel does, its just Denzel. Not hating on the guy, just call it as I see it.    As a person, he is a good fella. A buddy of mine has worked with him a few times, most recently on Deja Vu. Denzel can play a practical joke and take one as well. Not easily said for the likes of Tom Cruise.</body>

 <body>    Okay Carbon copy was his first movie alot of great actor's dont give good performance's in thier first movie and Virtuosity was a bad movie all together so your is still invalid.So are you saying the guy has no talent or you just you don't like his style?</body>

 <body>It takes talent to remember lines but for acting gigs Denzel desperatly needs to expand his horizons away from the angry black man with a smirk. A great actor can bring a character to life where nobody else could. In other words, you can not imagine anyone else in the role such as Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.      as far as my two picks of bad films being invalid, nope, you asked for one I gave you two, lol.</body>
