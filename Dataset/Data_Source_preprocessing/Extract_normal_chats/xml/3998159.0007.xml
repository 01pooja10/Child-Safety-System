      <body>We don't need anyone to talk to Iran or convince them not to go nuclear. Iran is not a threat to the United States and certainly never will be, and if you believe that they are you are paranoid and out of touch with reality.</body>

      <body>* Despite O'Bama's pathetic book (Soon to be turned into an epic movie staring Wesley Snipes {on condition that he wins his appeal} andÂ  Angelina Jolie) if it's between him and McLame, I'll have to go for the big O.  * The European Union is just as, if not more, concerned about nukes in Iran. Let them take the lead here.  * Overlooked in all of this is just who the hell is supplying Iran with the technology? The point being, why is the US barking at the dog instead of going after it's master....Russia?  * Even IF Iran develops nukes (Big IF) they don't have much of a delivery system and certainly nothing in the range that would put the US in "Harms Way." Again, a European problem.  * Speaking of "Harms Way", the State of Israel would be Iran's intended target.Â  Bush, as well as his predecessors have all been lap-dogs to the Jewish lobby and it's interests. I don't see any of the Presidential candidates changing that unfortunate trend either. Alls more the pity.</body>

      <body>  Well that's funny. Last I heard Snipes got two years in the pen for tax evasion. I guess this is his plea bargain.....playing some kook in a movie.  Like my man a couple of posts up said....Uran is no threat. They have no nukes. It's all hype &amp; fear mongering.</body>

      <body>  This passage doesn't exist in either of his books.Â  And if you're going to make a pathetic attempt to smear Obama as a racist, at the very least get the name of his book right.</body>

      <body>  I stand corrected. This ONE quote is not Obama's words, but rather Steve Sailer's, writing for The American Conservative.Â That's what I get for posting an email I received and not double checkingÂ every quote.  FYI - I post to debate not to smear anyone. IfÂ Obama, Hillary or McCainÂ can't take the heat, they should get out of the kitchen!</body>

      <body>Tensas, you've really outdone yourself. You really need to research before you post stuff like this because most of this stuff is patently untrue, the original quotes are doctored, or it's compeltely out of context.  If you want to know what he actually wrote:   Check Your Facts</body>
