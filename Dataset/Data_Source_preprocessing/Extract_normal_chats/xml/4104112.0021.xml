 <body>Well, as others have already said, it was at a bar and it is quite silly to judge an entire nation solely on your experience there. It isn't valid evidence for what you are arguing.  However... I do believe that Americans, whilst not being inherently less intelligent, are, on average, more ignorant than other nationalities about the world around them. Why? Americans grow up without many "outside" influences in the media - I would say that 98 percent of your television and film content is American made, american produced, directed, acted..... most of the music that gets commercial airplay in the states are also very much american dominated. Also, geographically, america is quite isolated, really.... sure, britain is an island, but it's only a hop skip and a jump to about 20 different countries...</body>

 <body> Why is it exaggerated? I don't think saying 98 percent of America's film and television content is American...</body>
