      <body>Here is oneâ&#128;¦prove that Past present and further donâ&#128;&#153;t really exists, that the perception of â&#128;&#156;timeâ&#128;&#157; is simply just conciseness, ability to process information and memory.</body>

      <body>This is a rather fun one that I always wanted to do. Even though most winners at science fairs are biology projects this one is still way cool and is a physics one.    You measure the speed of light. Here is what you need a microwave (without the automatic turn table), some chocolate or cheese, an accurate ruler (measurements in milimeters), a plate.    What you do is break up the cheese or chacolate and spread it up along the plate. Put it in the microwave and turn it on... observe it and wait for small parts of it to melt. This phenomina happens because the microwaves which are inside your microwave oven form a standing wave. This is why you have to stir food in it to cook it or have a turn table, or have you ever noticed how one bit will be real hot, and then the bite right next to it will be ice cold? The goal is to let it form a few hot spots that melt the cheese in those places. Then you want to take a ruler and measure the distance between each of the hotspots. You now know the wavelength of microwaves, it will be best to convert this length into meters (it will be like .005 meters or something like that though) . Now to figure out the speed of light    c = speed of light (electromagnetic radiation)  l = wavelength of the light  f = frequency of the light    The equation is as follows    c = l*f    You measured l, now to get f, look on the back of the microwave and look for the frequency of the waves. It will probably be in MHz or something like that (I don't remember the frequencies of microwaves off the top of my head). Mulitply l times f and you have just figured out the speed of light!</body>

      <body>hey, that's supposed to be a riddle! don't give it away      anyhow, you want some fun stuff, there's all kinds of stuff. you could make a tesla coil or vand de graff machine. Those are fun</body>

      <body>Duckweed. Use duckweed. It produces a shitload of protein . I did something about the effects of different fertilizers (including guppy poop...ever try to figure out the nitrogen composition of guppy shit?). It would be interesting to see how different growing conditions influence protein production, or find the optimum condition for protein production in a natural setting and try to increase it. pH, temperature, light access, etc.</body>
