      <body> Quite frankly, I don't give a damn about the world court. They can kiss my yankee ass.  Given how tilted our justice system is toward defendants, I'm sure this guy got his fair trial. Bottom line, don't come over and think you're going to get away with murder. Especially in Texas.</body>

      <body>  Again, you've missed the point.Ã&#130;Â  The dirtbag was not denied any rights all the way through his original trial &amp; all of his appeals.Ã&#130;Â  The courts gave him every right he asked for, and he was convicted.Ã&#130;Â  It wasn't until AFTER it was too late that he brought up his citizenship.Ã&#130;Â  No treaty was violated.Ã&#130;Â  He and his legal council allowed him to be convicted without contact with the Mexican government.Ã&#130;Â  It's not the fault of the Texas court system that his legal council was incompetant.Ã&#130;Â  It's not the fault of Texas that he chose to rape and murder in a state that EXECUTES murderers.Ã&#130;Â  He was a fool &amp; a murderer &amp; he got what he deserved.</body>

      <body>   This piece of crap lived longer than one of his victims.  I find it funny (okay, not really) how these humanists who are all for protecting lives (allegedly) find themselves backing someone who took away two lives.  If that does not call for an execution, well, too bad.</body>
