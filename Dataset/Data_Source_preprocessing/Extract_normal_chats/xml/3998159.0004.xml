      <body>  Bush didn't talk to them. They're the Axis of Evil, remember? And we don't negotiate with terrorists, remember? And you can't possibly think that those quotes would win Obama votes. You can't really do much in this country without the white vote and it's not like, especially when taken out of context, those quotes really help him in any way.</body>

      <body>We don't need anyone to talk to Iran or convince them not to go nuclear. Iran is not a threat to the United States and certainly never will be, and if you believe that they are you are paranoid and out of touch with reality.</body>

      <body>* Despite O'Bama's pathetic book (Soon to be turned into an epic movie staring Wesley Snipes {on condition that he wins his appeal} andÂ  Angelina Jolie) if it's between him and McLame, I'll have to go for the big O.  * The European Union is just as, if not more, concerned about nukes in Iran. Let them take the lead here.  * Overlooked in all of this is just who the hell is supplying Iran with the technology? The point being, why is the US barking at the dog instead of going after it's master....Russia?  * Even IF Iran develops nukes (Big IF) they don't have much of a delivery system and certainly nothing in the range that would put the US in "Harms Way." Again, a European problem.  * Speaking of "Harms Way", the State of Israel would be Iran's intended target.Â  Bush, as well as his predecessors have all been lap-dogs to the Jewish lobby and it's interests. I don't see any of the Presidential candidates changing that unfortunate trend either. Alls more the pity.</body>

      <body>  Well that's funny. Last I heard Snipes got two years in the pen for tax evasion. I guess this is his plea bargain.....playing some kook in a movie.  Like my man a couple of posts up said....Uran is no threat. They have no nukes. It's all hype &amp; fear mongering.</body>

      <body>  This passage doesn't exist in either of his books.Â  And if you're going to make a pathetic attempt to smear Obama as a racist, at the very least get the name of his book right.</body>
