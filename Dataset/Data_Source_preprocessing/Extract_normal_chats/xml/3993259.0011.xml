 <body>   There was no point to leave the names on the ballots since the states were stripped of all its delegates to the national convention for breaking party rules by moving its primary to before February 5. All candidates abided by an agreement not to campaign in Florida, and all major candidates except for Hillary Clinton had removed their names from the Michigan ballot.</body>

 <body>  What do you think is gonna happen with the immigration issue? Do you think 12-15 million illegals are gonna be deported? There's no way thats gonna happen. Mass deportations are out of the picture so its time to look at comprehensive immigration reform.</body>

 <body>   so what? its still a primary; where the people of that state had a voice and the option to vote. Again, please point out why its Michigan's fault for not putting Obama's name on the ballot, when HE asked them to take his name off?  sorry, but its Obama's fault for pulling his name. An election is an election, no matter if the votes for the DELEGATE count matters or not.  Again, if the democrats would abolish this stupid "delegate" system, you wouldn't be using this poor excuse.</body>

 <body>   Has to do with some video of Michelle Obama speaking somewhere. The republicans want to use it as a "nail" in Obama's campaign to discredit him.</body>
