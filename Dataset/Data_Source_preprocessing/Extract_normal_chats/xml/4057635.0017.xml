      <body>once again cons are showing the hypocrites that they are.  waterboarding is torture, you have hung people for committing this crime.  you can't even live up to the justice you espouse others to follow...  any of you in this thread excusing the "type" of method, if you believe in a higher power, he certainly is looking down on you today. but then, your only true god has been money anyways...  shameless hypocrites  its indefensible. its torture. and you no longer should ever be given the keys to any power what-so-ever. you have lost every inch of credibility to govern. you have turned your back on the constitution, morality, the american people, the soldiers and humanity.   you have completely lost your shit</body>

      <body>I respect christopher hitchens for subjecting himself to this to learn more and be more credible when writing about it. This is great journalism. I wish whoever becomes presidnt would have the balls to do this before deciding on it. Even in war it used to be leaders would lead on the field in battle. george washington lead in the field. Today presidents lead wars from air conditioned offices.  Also black journalist need to step up, we should of volunteered for this first and make news on the subject. As a spoken Word artist who wants to write a poem on the subject I am willing to volunteer for it but dont know how to make it happen.  I wonder could I bet hitchens. I think all I would have to do is just hold my breath for 1 minute. How hard could that be? You go under water you can hold your breathe for one minute. Why did it look painless? he said the CIA says about 30 seconds is average for the arabs being subjected to it. We need to see a waterboarding video of the real thing. And how in the hell is playing pop music gonna terrify hitchens? that music is only annoying to muslim extremist. They should of found out the worse music hitchens likes and used that.</body>

      <body>  Why don't you tell that to the idiot who says Hitchens was "acting like he couldn't get up" after actually being waterboarded. Get your shit out of here Luke, fucking loser.</body>
