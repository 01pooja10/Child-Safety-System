 <body>  better to be just war criminals than to be war criminals and hypocrits also??  they did the right thing...if they don't plan on honoring all these past treaties and such, they need to just pull out of them... hopefully an administration in the future will work to restore all the damage this administration has done.</body>

 <body>  It's called common decency. No need to attach "We are the world" to it. But is something we do not possess anymore.</body>

 <body>Thats what your taught in berkeley huh. Maybe one day you will get your wish and those poor "suspected terrorists" will be allowed to freely walk the streets of America. After all it would be the just thing to do after "illegally" holding them against there will. Maybe we can give them a nice big house and a million dollars too. Perhaps a wall, like the Vietnam Memorial, where we can put the names of those terrorists who died "fighting the biggest threat in the world to human rights"</body>

 <body>Its not just terrorists we are talking about here, we have lost all sense of morality. We have lost our value for life and common decency, just look at our city streets. The nation's capital is setting checkpoints to curb crime, "patriots" suggest we shoot illegals on site, our law enforcement is just as corrupt as it is in Mexico, a 78 yr old man gets hit by a car and people just stand around and look, no one runs to help..etc etc. We have become worse then the terrorists we are supposedly fighting in the middle east.</body>

 <body>  I know.....Check Points. Don't people even realize that comes from Nazi Germany? What does that say about America? Anyway I heard they are going to be doing drug check points around these summer concerts that come up every year starting this summer. Man! They might find some serious convicts like a guy who smokes mariajuana!</body>

 <body> Well, maybe they'll pick YOU next time, Elmer Fudd... If you look too much like an Iraqi or they see some other minor coincidence that "alerts" them to perceive you as a threat. Of course, once they abduct you, you'll never get a trial or have any way to prove your innocence.  With an attitude like yours, you'd deserve it.</body>
