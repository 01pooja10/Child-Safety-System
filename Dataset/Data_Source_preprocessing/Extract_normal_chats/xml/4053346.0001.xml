 <body>unfortunatly everything that is adapted into a movie has alot missing theres threads on x-men,hulk etc. what i will give bay credit for is that he kept the movie with a real sense of aww, watching them transform was very incredible even though they were different very aesthetically pleasing and fun..it was a fun movie to watch and i enjoyed</body>

 <body>I do like Bay's style when it comes to action. The transformation scenes made me a little dizzy, they were too close up at times. But he does have a knack for action.</body>

 <body>I'm sure the next movie will expand on Starscream's personality.  If not, too bad.</body>

 <body>I still think that Michael Bay focused on the humans more than the Transformers.  It was almost as if the robots were just thrown in as eye candy.</body>

 <body>i liked the transformers movie..loved it in fact and i literally grew up on the transformers. i thought it told a good story and the action was tight my only complaint is the transformations looked too complicated..there was too many parts n shit movin for me..i think if they had kept the transforming a little closer to the cartoon it would have been perfect..another complaint i have is megatron n starscream was fuckin ugly..they could have made starscream look a little like he did in the cartoon at least and megatron was just plain ass ugly if he comes back in part 2 or 3 maybe they will have him actually scan a jet or somethin to turn into like the rest of em did</body>
