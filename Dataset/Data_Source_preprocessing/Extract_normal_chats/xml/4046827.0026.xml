 <body>I think you be the first person eva said he wanted something to make him think. I ain't neva had nobody that had to be made to think, they usually just thunk on they own.  I kinda like that you need some motivating factors to get ya thinking, gives me more time to stick ya in the box - and you can do plenty a thinking in there.  Why don't you mosey on ever and see what the last girl was thinking when we put her in the box. I got that on film so we could all remember the good ol' days.  I reckon you can find it somewhere in the list.</body>
