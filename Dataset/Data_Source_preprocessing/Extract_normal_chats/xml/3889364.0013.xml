 <body>  Thankyou. Where are all these Reagan Conservatives I keep hearing about? I really hope their silence on this topic is because they are all deep in contemplation, wrestling with their own inner demons.  I'll assume that.</body>

 <body>  No, blacks were not given access to credit and property in the manner that whites were due to racism. In the 60's many black neighborhoods were destroyed to make the interstate highway system, the replacement was high density public housing. In 68, when king died blacks destroyed their own commercial centers, but these were OWNED by whites and rented to blacks. That was part of the anger, to this day most of these places are still just as they were after the riots. In combination with the drugs that were imported into the cities by Regean to destroy the black pride movement, these things destroyed confidence and morale in the black community, causing them to blame the man. Most of the children from the 70's grew up to be either cynical adults, or backstabbers to the ppl they left behind when they made it, like Barrack and Michelle Obama.</body>

 <body>  reagan was a demagogue.ÃÂ  I see that now.ÃÂ  But he did effectively enrapture the nation in patriotism, to a fault.ÃÂ  most didn't see the fractured thinking of reaganomics until the 90's when it was too late.ÃÂ  the reason that you're not hearing from reagan conservatives is because most have morph'd either into the army of "compassionate conservatives" or as myself have morph'd into independent voters who look a little more analytically at politics now.</body>

 <body>  So you're a racist too then? Got ya.  I wouldn't have said that, no matter how close a friend he was to me. The fact is he's a racist, so is Lott, and Lott even went on a crying jag apologizing left and right for his remarks.  Even he thinks it was wrong.</body>

 <body>   This was addressed Ken Mellman did apologized for the use of the Southern Stragety but many hardcore conservatives like Hannity and Limbaugh said that its a waste of time.</body>

 <body>  He was longtime good friends with James Brown, and actually pleaded on his behalf when Brown got locked up later in life. He changed his ways.</body>
