      <body>  That was my suggesion too. If everyone would grow some nuts and vote for who they like best, as opposed to the lesser of 2 evils, things might change. People are afraid to "waste their vote", which keeps the Democrats/Republicans in power. IMO, a vote for either major party at this point is a wasted vote, at least in the Presidential race. Of course, there isn't much for 3rd chouces either, but at least it sends a message.</body>

      <body>you should vote because it is a right given to you...you either exercise it or you lose it. not voting doesn't change a thing or make any sort of statement or give you more of a right to criticize, no matter what george carlin said, god rest his soul. and voting for a third party or a rebel or a renegade isn't a wasted vote either as most party pollywannacrackers would like you to believe. it's just their way of ensuring that two and only two (arguably one) parties stay in power and to squash that the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and even seven parties that a nation this age and of such diversity should have by now.</body>
