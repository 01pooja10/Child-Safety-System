      <body>    hey Im not complaining. I like watching a good spear thru the head as much as the next guy. Mel's blood lust is my viewing pleasure. And as much as professor Claven's yapping about historical accuracy is true, I think its pretty damn obvious looking at his films the man likes displaying his ultraviolence. There is complete justification for the horrific realism in Passion of the Christ too. It definitley worked for the effect he was going for. But he was having way too much fun with beating down ol' JC.</body>

      <body>    Call me crazy, but isn't this movie about the Mayans? I haven't seen it yet, but if the movie is ultraviolent, then it's historically accurate. The mayans were a blood thristy violent race of people. I've visited mayan ruins and learned about the history behind them. They were savages, pure and simple, and if the film wasn't ultraviolent it would be doing a disservice to the reality behind their culture.</body>

      <body>i thought the ending was weak....it left it too open for interpretation as to....were the xtian spanish there as savior types? or were they put in at the end to give the movie a what comes around goes around moral? it seemed like they ran out of money or time and left it hanging at the end.</body>

      <body>    Yes, I've seen it. I have a short review on my page (don't know if this is permitted to say, so delete /ignore/whatever! if so)    I highly recommend reading something about the movie before seeing it, if you plan to. Otherwise, most people will be befuddled, as the apparent plot isn't extremely clear - and lost in translation a bit too! I'm fascinated with the Inca, Aztec and Mayan cultures so was looking forward to seeing this. Don't know that this is a spectacular movie, but I think the depiction of the culture is pretty accurate.
