      <body>  I call Bullshit. Americans are held responsible to the laws of other countries, always have been, always will be. Don't think so? Go spit on the sidewalk in Singapore, see what happens.</body>

      <body>Call it bullshit if you want. If said American citizen was arrested for spitting on a Singapore sidewalk before today, the government of Singapore would be required to advise the American consulate in Singapore of the arrest and grant consular access to the arrested party. Yes, the poor slob would probably not avoid a fine and/or jail time but the consulate would be able to ensure that his rights were honoured under Singapore law and assist him in retaining local counsel. As of today, Singapore no longer has to advise the consulate nor permit consular access.</body>

      <body>  I belive your statement is based on the FALSE assertion that this scum bag was denied the right to speak to a Mexican Consular. He was in fact NOT denied that right.Â  He and his legal council both neglected to request to speak to the Mexican Consular.Â  If they had requested, they would have been granted their request.Â  It wasn't until AFTER his conviction and AFTER his appeals that they finally decided to mention that he wasn't a US citizen, which is what everyone was previously lead to believe.Â   Neither theÂ prosecution, nor the court had any knowledge of the nation of origin of this douche.Â  Due to the circumstances of his conviction, the world court has NO JURISDICTION over this case.Â  They would like to have, and they might try to say that they have it ... but they don't.Â  Even the US Supreme court reviewed it &amp; agreed that the world court has no jurisdiction.</body>

      <body> Quite frankly, I don't give a damn about the world court. They can kiss my yankee ass.  Given how tilted our justice system is toward defendants, I'm sure this guy got his fair trial. Bottom line, don't come over and think you're going to get away with murder. Especially in Texas.</body>

      <body>  Again, you've missed the point.Ã&#130;Â  The dirtbag was not denied any rights all the way through his original trial &amp; all of his appeals.Ã&#130;Â  The courts gave him every right he asked for, and he was convicted.Ã&#130;Â  It wasn't until AFTER it was too late that he brought up his citizenship.Ã&#130;Â  No treaty was violated.Ã&#130;Â  He and his legal council allowed him to be convicted without contact with the Mexican government.Ã&#130;Â  It's not the fault of the Texas court system that his legal council was incompetant.Ã&#130;Â  It's not the fault of Texas that he chose to rape and murder in a state that EXECUTES murderers.Ã&#130;Â  He was a fool &amp; a murderer &amp; he got what he deserved.</body>

      <body>   This piece of crap lived longer than one of his victims.  I find it funny (okay, not really) how these humanists who are all for protecting lives (allegedly) find themselves backing someone who took away two lives.  If that does not call for an execution, well, too bad.</body>
