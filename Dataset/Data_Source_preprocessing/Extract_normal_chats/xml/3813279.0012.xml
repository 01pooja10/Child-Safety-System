 <body>He's great. I loved him in War, which would have been an awesome movie if the ending wasn't such a fail.</body>

 <body>  that new guy ritchie movie he was in "revolver" is soooooo good. sure again statham is a tough guy, but it sheds here in this movie. i used to say lock stock was his best role but revolver now is really his best work.</body>

 <body>I watched Revolver last night... And it is really good. The critics that ripped on it and called it a mess are wrong. Sure, it's complicated and might confuse some, but so what. Personally, I loved it.</body>

 <body>  if there was one thing i didn't like it was the very end when they were rolling the credits. i don't know if they have that commentary by doctors and specialists at the end in the dvd release but they did have it in the theatrical release and it annoyed me for some reason. i think it's because it just started to feel a little blow hardy and didn't allow me to think for myself you know? it felt like it was kinda laying things down for me.</body>
