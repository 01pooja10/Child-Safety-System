      <body>   This piece of crap lived longer than one of his victims.  I find it funny (okay, not really) how these humanists who are all for protecting lives (allegedly) find themselves backing someone who took away two lives.  If that does not call for an execution, well, too bad.</body>

      <body>  I love this part: "This is another murder because no one has the right to take someone else's life, only God," said Medellin's cousin Reyna Armendariz.  Well Reyna, how about the 16 year old and the 14 year old girls that were brutally raped and murdered? Why didn't your DEAD cousin live by this same philosophy? Thank God the great state of Texas still upholds the law and protects its citizens. If more states would wake the fuck up and put more of these assholes to sleep this kind of shit would slow down to a near halt. Too bad they won't air these executions on pay per view. Then we could give the proceeds to the victims families and some of these fucking animals would see for themselves what rape and murder will get you. DEAD!  My sympathy goes out to the families of these girls. I can't imagine what this did to them.</body>

      <body>  Agreed! The only unfortunate part of your comment Mara Jade is the fact that more states should live by the same standards, not just Texas.</body>
