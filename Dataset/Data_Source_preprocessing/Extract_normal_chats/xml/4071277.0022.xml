 <body> You mean a good lawyer, right?  I got my older brother. He's an attorney. Although it would have to deal with real estate. Otherwise, I'm fucked.</body>

 <body> Not yet. But as an educator, I keep my fingers crossed. We're too sue-happy. I love when parents threaten to sue you if you fail their kid who never did homework and always ditches class.</body>

 <body>  In general, ÃÂ I completely disagree. ÃÂ Yes, there are those who are new and doing it for the experience, and there are those who are doing it because they have to and really donÃ¢â¬â¢t care because they are getting far less for representing someone under the Public Defenders arrangement that they would from a paying customer.ÃÂ  But there are also those who are doing it because they have a desire to see that everyone is defended. ÃÂ  I was on a murder jury where the defendant was defended by the Public Defenders office.ÃÂ  These guys threw their hearts and souls into the defense.ÃÂ  Too bad the guy was guilty as hell, but they mounted several appeals after the conviction, interviewed every member of the jury that would talk to them, and I understand that they are still trying to get this dude out.ÃÂ  I contrast that to a lawyer I had, gave him a large retainer, and he withdrew from the case after he had spent it all, much more, and I asked him to put me on a payment plan.</body>

 <body>It's the system that is at fault here. Even if they come forward, there's a good chance it wouldn't have made a difference. Having said that, however, had it been me, I would have went to the judge and DA and told what I know and given up the license. At least, maybe, the verdict could have been overturned. Only maybe, but worth a shot. Even if they didn't give up their client, just said that someone else confessed to the crime. What I don't get is why they didn't do it after their client got convicted. He was done for anyway.</body>

 <body>  Well in that case we could just cut one down......even when we need one there still hated. when you think of a lawyer the first thing that always comes to mind is your going to get screwed.  Funny that your bro is a real estate attorney. In my one post about getting screwed over by the one I retained, dealed exclusivly with real estate law. The deception he used to justify his costs was unbelievable, using most of the retainer in phone calls to me "reviewing the facts" over and over again. That scumbag even billed me for creating a bill. By the time he actually contacted the developer most of the retainer was gone and of course he needed more money to continue.  There's some things that most decent people don't do, however seems normal for lawyers to cross that line. There in the same class as a funeral director, acting like they feel for your pain and loss, then turn around and sell you a 1,000 casket for 10 grand, of course at the same time selling you a bill of goods that how your departed would be better respected in the silk lined box with the gold plated hardware.</body>

 <body> But its okay for an indigent client to get convicted, and who ends up spending a LONG time in jail, or who gets a death sentence when they cannot prove their innocence? Seems in this case that ONLY the underworld "hitmen", drug cartel traffikers, "high rolling" pimps, and bikers who can afford $250-$700,00 an hour can afford "justice" and are more likely to "walk"!</body>
