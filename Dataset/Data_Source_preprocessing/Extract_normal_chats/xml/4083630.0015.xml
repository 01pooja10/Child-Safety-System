 <body>Bale's Batman voice was shit. (and that concludes the list of things not awesome about "The Dark Knight")  The movie is badass. Best (non indie) of the Year. (mainstream NEVER tops indie)  And now, Corrections to dumb comments made earlier by people who just didn't know any better:  1) "The Dark Knight" is a gift from god... Specifically to me. 2) Ledger's "Joker" is in fact the greatest portrayl of a (super)villain of all times. Primarily due to the fact that He played it in such a realistic way. If a super villain like "The Joker" did really exist, I imagine that he'd be exactly like that. Most super villains in movies don't have the level of realistic character depth, that Ledger, (along with the amazing writers) brought to the "joker".ÃÂ  Besides... I dare the OP to suggest who IS the greatest villain then, since "the joker isn't" 3)I agree that other films have been storywise on par (and better) than The Dark Knight... But what makes this one stand out is that it was done on a mainstream scale.ÃÂ  This movie is VERY noir, and dark, unhappy movies are generally not so big with the mass public.ÃÂ  Thats why we've rarely seen it done (if ever), in a guaranteed blockbuster hit like a Batman movie (or any other big name superhero movie)ÃÂ  I think with the success of "The Dark Knight" big budget studios may stop "playing it safe" and start producing more films that think outside "hollywood box".  -Dark Knight was awesome.ÃÂ  Very Awesome.</body>

 <body>Batman was thinking outside of the "hollywood box"?  hahahahahahahahahaha  and apparently professors should start using this movie as a prime example for character study and development. Because, obviously, Heath Ledger is the greatest actor of all time. Get real.</body>

 <body>I really don't get these psycho fanboys attacking everyone who didn't like the damn movie. It's a f***ing Batman movie, grow up!  All your bitching and moaning won't change the fact that the movie was just "OK" and nonething more.  No one deserves an oscar and no new ground was broke.  The f***ing Batmobile was stopped by a stupid rocket launcher! WTF?? ha ha ha!  It was a kids movie written to appeal to the emo generation... I guess that explains all the "boo hoos" and "I'll kill myself if Heath don't get an oscar!"  Some of you REALLY need to get outside more ;)</body>
