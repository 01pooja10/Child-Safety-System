 <body>Every James Bond movie opens with an insane, incredible stunt, which has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, then they play that cool Bond music and show the bloody eye and get on with the movie...</body>

 <body>The Wild Bunch is pretty cool.  Kids watching a scorpion sting itself to death, followed by an incredibly violent robbery/shoot-out in which half the towns-folk and half the robbers get shot.  By the end of the first scene, half the cast have already died!</body>

 <body>Indiana Jones (Temple of Doom).  During the opening scene he is poisoned by Chinese gangsters while bartering for a diamond, shot at, skewers somebody with a kebab and has a fight surrounded by dancing girls and balloons before jumping out the window with his chosen date for the night.    How cool is that?</body>
