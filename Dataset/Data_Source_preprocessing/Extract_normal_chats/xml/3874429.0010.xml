 <body>It's a pretty simple prescription, really. Cut taxes, cut spending, and STOP INFLATING!  That should fly with politicians and the public about as well as recommendations for diet and exercise to improve their health. Why go to all that pain and effort, when there just HAS to be a magic pill that can fix it all?</body>

 <body>Who said anything about being an isolationist? Its about being a non-interventionist and mind your own business but still trade and travel. Do you call other countries isolationist because they dont police the world?</body>

 <body>  Our troops being stationed in other countries such as Germany and Japan have more to do with international economical matters than anything else. Withdrawing our forces from peaceful overseas assignments will cripple several national economies worldwide and cause an international economic crisis.</body>

 <body>   Take a world economics class, then delve into the finer points of the Defense Budget. For example, the U.S. doesn't own any of the land in the countries it has forces stationed (peacefully or otherwise). The land is rented. In Germany money is paid to the German Government every time a military vehicle is driving off of the installation. The German Government is paid a fee every time a hole is dug on the military installation itself, too. Same thing with the use of the rifle range. Let's not even get into the millions of dollars spent every year by the troops themselves within the country (the alcohol purchase alone would fund a couple of social programs here in the U.S.).  When we first set up the airbase in Hungary in support of the Operation Joint Endeavor in 1995 we almost tripled two-thirds of the country's Gross National Product.  South Korea actually only pays about 20% of their defense budget; we handle the rest in accordance of their treaty. If we were to just up and leave, they'd have to make up that last 80% in the face of North Korea's "million man army."  Need more examples?</body>

 <body>   That just sounds like one big bureaucracy to me. While foreign countries are profiting from the US bases; the National Debt goes up even further.  Do we really need that many bases overseas?</body>

 <body>   My information is based on my education as well as my experience. I have been personally involved in the above examples in some form or another, be it working with S-3/G-3 or dealing with the local bureaucracy.  As I stated, take some international economics classes and take a look at teh details of the Defense Budget.</body>

 <body>  We don't, no, not after the break-up of the Soviet Union, but those bases are such an integral part of the world economy at this point we wouldn't be able to shut them all down without causing serious amounts of economic damage.</body>

 <body>Believe me, guys, I'm very much a "take care of our own first" kinda guy. I firmly believe we should withdraw all forces from overseas, peaceful or otherwise. I don't see the need for 14 active Aircraft Carriers plus escorts, either. I also hate the fact that so much of our own economy is tied up in the world market, as well as the fact that we pay out billions in foreign aid when we've got people starving in the streets.  I'm a staunch isolationist; always have been.  However, what I like and don't like doesn't change the facts. I'm willing to make the sacrifices necessary to withdraw into our shells and take care of ourselves first, but I can't make that choice for the rest of the country (which is why I will never run for office). What's good for me isn't always good for everyone else.</body>
